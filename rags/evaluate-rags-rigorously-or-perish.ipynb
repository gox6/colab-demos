If the on-site \\\"wall of SPAM\\\" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto \\\"Any Day Above Ground is a Good One.\\\" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of \\\"fantasy coffins\\\" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the \\\"hobo jungle,\\\" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have \\\"caught the westbound\\\" are laid to rest. 4. The M\\u00fctter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the M\\u00fctter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor \\\"Greatest Show on Earth\\\" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean \\\"enthusiasts\\\") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring \\\"mainstream\\\" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.  Watch a report on whether the children are orphans \\u00bb . Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \\\"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\\\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \\\"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\\\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \\\"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\\\" the agencies said. \\\"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\\\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \\\"illegal and irresponsible.\\\" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \\\"one way or the other\\\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear \\\"intimate\\\" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours \\u00bb . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear \\\"scene setting\\\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \\\"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\\\" referring to Diana's son Prince William. \\\"I'm hoping for justice,\\\" Al Fayed said outside court. \\\"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\\\" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. \\\"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\\\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. \\\"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\\\" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down.\\\" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. \\\"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones.\\\"  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape \\u00bb . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. \\\"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,\\\" Babineau said. \\\"It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies.\\\" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. \\\"I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,\\\" he said. \\\"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. \\\"I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos.\\\" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble \\u00bb . Babineau said he had no rescue training. \\\"I just knew what I had to do at the moment.\\\" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. \\\"You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,\\\" Hughes said.

The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used \\\"monitored anesthesia care,\\\" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president.

NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \\\"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\\\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \\\"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\\\" The suspension makes \\\"a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,\\\" he said in a statement.  Watch what led to Vick's suspension \\u00bb . Goodell said the Falcons could \\\"assert any claims or remedies\\\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of \\\"Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture\\\" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, \\\"full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,\\\" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. \\\"The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,\\\" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. \\\"Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,\\\" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. \\\"Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' \\\" Vick also agreed that \\\"collective efforts\\\" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. \\\"Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. \\\"Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,\\\" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.  See a timeline of the case against Vick \\u00bb . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \\\"It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,\\\" Toobin said Friday. \\\"The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' \\\" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to \\\"make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\\\" with the dogs that are being held by the government. \\\"Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals.\\\" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to \\\"arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property.\\\" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to \\\"approximately\\\" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen \\\"a statement of facts\\\" in the case.  E-mail to a friend .

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act.

Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child.

Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as \\\"El Negro Acacio,\\\" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. \\\"After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,\\\" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. \\\"The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself.\\\" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia.

He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman.

He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before.

President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \\\"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\\\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. \\\"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\\\" Bush will say. \\\"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \\\" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. \\\"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\\\" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \\\"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. \\\"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\\\" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \\\"provide broader context\\\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \\\"surge\\\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government \\u00bb . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. \\\"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\\\" Bush will say. \\\"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\\\" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \\\"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\\\" \\\"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\\\" Bush will say. \\\"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday .

There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference. \\\"They are done. It's finished,\\\" the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune. \\\"It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed,\\\" the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in. Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called \\\"a long shot\\\" by an official. MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. \\\"Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,\\\" he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. \\\"The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options.\\\" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. \\\"I will never come back to that evil mountain,\\\" he said.

The world's famous footballer has begun a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team, and on Friday Beckham will meet the press and reveal his new shirt number. This week, we take an in depth look at the life and times of Beckham, as CNN's very own \\\"Becks,\\\" Becky Anderson, sets out to examine what makes the man tick -- as footballer, fashion icon and global phenomenon. It's a long way from the streets of east London to the Hollywood Hills and Becky charts Beckham's incredible rise to football stardom, a journey that has seen his skills grace the greatest stages in world soccer. She goes in pursuit of the current hottest property on the sports/celebrity circuit in the U.S. and along the way explores exactly what's behind the man with the golden boot. CNN will look back at the life of Beckham, the wonderfully talented youngster who fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, his marriage to pop star Victoria, and the trials and tribulations of playing for England. We'll look at the highs (scoring against Greece), the lows (being sent off during the World Cup), the Man. U departure for the Galacticos of Madrid -- and now the Home Depot stadium in L.A. We'll ask how Beckham and his family will adapt to life in Los Angeles -- the people, the places to see and be seen and the celebrity endorsement. Beckham is no stranger to exposure. He has teamed with Reggie Bush in an Adidas commercial, is the face of Motorola, is the face on a PlayStation game and doesn't need fashion tips as he has his own international clothing line.

Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. \\\"This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,\\\" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. \\\"Other stressors on the colony are likely involved.\\\" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. \\\"There are no cases ... in Australia at all,\\\" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. \\\"It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.\\\" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia. University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. \\\"One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,\\\" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. \\\"But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant.\\\" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. \\\"The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,\\\" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Besides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.

Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. Police released this mug shot of O.J. Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. \\\"We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,\\\" Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters. Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims. A reporter asked Nichols: Was \\\"O.J. was the boss in that room?\\\" Nichols responded, \\\"That is what we believe, yes.\\\"  Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs \\u00bb . The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as \\\"a home invasion-type robbery,\\\" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, \\\"There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J. Simpson.\\\" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. \\\"There is no truth to that whatsoever,\\\" he said. \\\"That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police.\\\" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. \\\"Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,\\\" Nichols said. \\\"We are still in the process of sorting that out.\\\" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But \\\"there was some other property taken as well,\\\" he said. \\\"I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff.\\\" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of the United States. But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths . Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson \\\"thinks he can do no wrong.\\\" \\\"He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,\\\" she said. \\\"Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back.\\\" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled \\\"If I Did It\\\" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award.

Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said. Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that Oakley, \\\"having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person.\\\" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and \\\"restricted data\\\" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \\\"into little pieces\\\" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \\\"pieces of scrap\\\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \\\"appliance\\\" under the law. \\\"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\\\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \\\"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\\\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the \\\"crown jewels,\\\" but they should not have been taken from the facility. A \\\"barrier\\\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \\\"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\\\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \\\"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\\\" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation \\\"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\\\" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and \\\"successfully identified the individual in question,\\\" he said.

Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. \\\"The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,\\\" Lee told Reuters. \\\"Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply.\\\" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and \\\"transplant tourists\\\" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. \\\"It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,\\\" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization. China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year. Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors. China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. \\\"What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,\\\" said the WHO's Noel. In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a \\\"kidney bazaar\\\", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys. Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations. In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing \\\"altruistic\\\" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). \\\"The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,\\\" said Karam. He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists. Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. \\\"The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,\\\" he told Reuters. \\\"It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values.\\\" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths. In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type. These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760). Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. \\\"Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,\\\" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. \\\"I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.\\\" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. \\\"For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,\\\" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like \\\"The Parent Trap,\\\" is too risky to cast in a film.  Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles \\u00bb . It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in \\\"Poor Things,\\\" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.  See a gallery of Lohan's films \\u00bb . A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. \\\"I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,\\\" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. \\\"It's pretty standard year to year.\\\" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be \\\"serious at this point.\\\" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, \\\"Georgia Rule,\\\" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. \\\"Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,\\\" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, \\\"minders\\\" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. \\\"I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,\\\" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.

In doing so, they ignored a request by Italy coach Roberto Donadoni to play the first round of matches midway through the month, to give his players time to gain match-fitness ahead of Euro 2008 qualifiers against France and Ukraine in early September. \\\"I'm ready to leave the Italian Players Association.

Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was \\\"my favorite thing,\\\" he said. Spider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes. The legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself. Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun. \\\"All right Youssif!\\\" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. \\\"It was my favorite thing,\\\" the boy said later. \\\"I want to see him again.\\\" He then felt compelled to add: \\\"I know it's not the real Spider-Man.\\\" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it.  See Youssif enjoy being a boy again \\u00bb . The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could. He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios. At one point, the car shook. Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. \\\"Even I was scared,\\\" the dad said. \\\"Well, I wasn't,\\\" Youssif replied. The father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day. Youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. \\\"Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?\\\" Youssif's father said in amazement. \\\"Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,\\\" he said. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States. They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. His mother heard her boy screaming from inside. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital.  Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister \\u00bb . The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. \\\"Anything for Youssif,\\\" he said. \\\"We had to do it.\\\" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen. The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. \\\"These are just some of the stories,\\\" said Youssif's mother, Zainab. Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a \\\"religious book,\\\" she said. Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed. \\\"Iraq finished,\\\" he said in what few English words he knows. He elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon. It's just not possible. Too much violence. Too many killings. His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. \\\"It's been a dream,\\\" the father said. He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. \\\"Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,\\\" the father said. At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below.

Cpl. Trent D. Thomas was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses -- including murder, larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and making false official statements -- for his involvement in the April 2006 death in Hamdaniya, Iraq. Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. They reported at the time that Awad planned to detonate a roadside bomb targeting their patrol. But several residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account, prompting a criminal investigation. Prosecutors accuse the group's squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops. Hutchins has pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy and other charges in the case. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Thomas changed his plea from guilty to not guilty in February, arguing that he had merely followed orders. He told his attorneys that after reviewing the evidence against him, he realized \\\"that what happened overseas happened as a result of obedience to orders, and he hasn't done anything wrong,\\\" defense attorney Victor Kelley said.

Here is his speech in full: . William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians: . I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech: . \\\"Who's cheating?\\\" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, \\\"the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted\\\". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: \\\"She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint.\\\" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: \\\"He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered.\\\" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of \\\"fury\\\" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her: . \\\"I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God.\\\" Amen.

But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority. The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: \\\"To change the law you sometimes have to break the law\\\". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968. Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable . In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship. Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.

Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven . Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled \\\"Bagatelle in A minor\\\" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written \\\"for Therese,\\\" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. \\\"Philadelphia Freedom\\\" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin . Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered \\\"amateurs\\\" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. \\\"Lola\\\" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies . Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, \\\"Lola\\\" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then \\\"Lola\\\" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's \\\"Walk on the Wild Side.\\\" (\\\"Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'.\\\") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says \\\"Lola\\\" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. \\\"867-5309/Jenny\\\" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call . Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. \\\"Oh, Carol\\\" Written by: Neil Sedaka . Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with \\\"Oh, Carol,\\\" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of \\\"Oh, Carol\\\" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled \\\"Oh, Neil.\\\" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. \\\"Oh, Neil\\\" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like \\\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\\" and \\\"The Loco-Motion.\\\" 6. \\\"It Ain't Me, Babe\\\" Written by: Bob Dylan . Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. \\\"Our House\\\" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. \\\"Our House\\\" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally \\\"lit a fire,\\\" while Mitchell \\\"placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day.\\\" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters.  See how spending breaks down for this year \\u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \\\"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\\\" \\\"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\\\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle.  Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \\u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \\\"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\\\" Tracey said. \\\"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\\\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \\\"Politics is completely beholden to events,\\\" he said. \\\"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\\\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \\\"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\\\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \\\"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance.

A Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA). All of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband. He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition. Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition, according to TNA.

For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. Meanwhile, Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phuket's airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor. U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a Boeing MD-82 -- was manufactured in the United States. One air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear, which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour (11 miles an hour) with stronger gusts, but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the pilot's alone, according to Phuket's airport manager. \\\"Air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot,\\\" Pornchai Eua-Aree said. One-Two-Go officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries. One-Two-Go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in Asia, and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. E-mail to a friend .

We get it.\\\" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that \\\"Sicko\\\" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. \\\"We [America] have a system built on profit,\\\" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. \\\"It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,\\\" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film \\\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\\" \\\"The government actually used to do things right,\\\" Moore said in response. \\\"The problem is who we put in power.\\\" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. \\\"I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue\\\" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.

A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the \\\"genocide\\\" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. \\\"I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,\\\" said Hoyer of Maryland. \\\"I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is.\\\" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. \\\"More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,\\\" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at \\\"a broad range of options\\\" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. \\\"We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,\\\" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. \\\"There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have.\\\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. \\\"About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,\\\" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs.  See Incirlik's key location \\u00bb . The U.S. military issued a \\\"warning order\\\" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

Mohammed Rasoul sitting with his mother, Jinan Khalifa, eagerly awaits his trip to the United States. Row after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city. Mohammed stops at his cousin's grave. \\\"I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,\\\" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it. The headstone reads: \\\"Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006.\\\" Clutching her photograph, Mohammed says, \\\"My cousin died on the scene.

I went outside and saw my son covered in blood from head to toe,\\\" she says. Her son endured 11 operations before doctors amputated his leg below the knee. Khalifa says her son put forward a tough face, but when he finally went back home the shock hit him. \\\"That's where his personality started to change. He stopped laughing,\\\" she says. \\\"It was tearing me up,\\\" Mohammed says \\\"It was hard for me to watch others play. And I couldn't, I couldn't walk, it agitated me.\\\" CNN first broadcast his story in May where it caught the attention of an American charity, the Global Medical Relief Fund, which offered to help. \\\"I cannot put my feelings into words,\\\" Khalifa says. \\\"An entire book would not be enough. They gave my son his hope back. The America we knew was one that came, bombed, harmed. But when this organization came forward, we saw another face of America.\\\" The Global Medical Relief Fund, a small charity based in New York that helps children of war and natural disasters, has arranged for surgery and treatment at the Shriners Children Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Elissa Montanti, the founder and director of the organization, says she was inspired to act when she first heard of Mohammed's tragic story. \\\"I said, 'Oh, please, let me help this boy.' \\\" Mohammed will arrive in the United States on Thursday afternoon. He will be fitted for a prosthetic leg in coming weeks and examined to see if he needs additional surgery. Montanti said her organization has a list of other young Iraqi children in need of help. \\\"The word needs to get out.\\\" Asked how it makes her feel to help Mohammed, she says, \\\"It makes me cry with joy.\\\" Mohammed, too, is ecstatic. \\\"I didn't think this act of human kindness would be presented to me,\\\" he says. \\\"I didn't have hope in Iraq -- hope that I would ever get my hope back. I didn't have a future.\\\" He adds, \\\"I want to go to America and meet this person that gave me my future back.\\\" When he comes back home, he wants to help rebuild Falluja, starting with his school, which was bombed during the 2004 Falluja offensive. \\\"I will never leave school and, God willing, I will continue my education and become an architect and build all the schools,\\\" he says, standing on his crutches.

Pratibha Patil, 72, is India's first elected female president. Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. \\\"This a victory of the people,\\\" Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. \\\"I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold.\\\" Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. \\\"This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India,\\\" Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as \\\"mud-slinging\\\", said on Saturday her victory was \\\"a vote against the politics of divisiveness\\\". \\\"All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered,\\\" Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a \\\"divine premonition\\\" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized. E-mail to a friend .

Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed.

At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are \\\"red tagged,\\\" meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are \\\"yellow tagged,\\\" which means residents can return for necessities, but cannot stay, Sanders said. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the landslide downed power lines and caused a minor gas leak. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported. The Red Cross opened a shelter at La Jolla High School. Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the Union-Tribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk told the newspaper. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. \\\"Gravity pulling on the incline is pulling down masses of earth and those masses of earth have houses on top of them,\\\" Abbott told the paper. \\\"It's a geologically bad site and should not have been built on to begin with.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"San Diego mayor declares state of emergency; White House, governor offer aid .

Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.  Watch a report on whether the children are orphans \\u00bb . Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \\\"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\\\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \\\"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\\\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \\\"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\\\" the agencies said. \\\"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\\\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \\\"illegal and irresponsible.\\\" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. \\\"I very quickly realized two things,\\\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \\\"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\\\" \\\"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening.\\\" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. \\\"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\\\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. \\\"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\\\" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \\\"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\\\" he said. \\\"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\\\" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. \\\"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\\\" he said. \\\"It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\\\" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. \\\"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\\\" he said. \\\"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\\\" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \\\"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,\\\" he said. \\\"We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\\\" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. \\\"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\\\" Schneider said. \\\"That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years . Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise .

In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted \\\"God is great\\\" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. \\\"Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,\\\" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. \\\"They will be like wounded animals.\\\" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects.

Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich. Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said. \\\"Early on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of interest,\\\" Dobrich said. \\\"I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect.\\\" New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. \\\"There are strong indications that it was a homicide,\\\" he said. \\\"That's why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first autopsy.\\\"  Watch why authorities want to exhume the body \\u00bb . Glasgow cited abrasions on Savio's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained. \\\"Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone,\\\" he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of Savio's death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. \\\"With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an accident,\\\" he said. \\\"That was clear.\\\" In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed. Savio's sister, Sue Doman, said Savio expressed fear of Drew Peterson. \\\"She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me. It's gonna look like an accident,' \\\" Doman said. Doman said she didn't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded. \\\"I don't understand accidental drowning. You just don't drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool. You just don't do that,\\\" she said. Meanwhile, friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive. The woman's aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the Peterson home in suburban Chicago last month. \\\"She said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7, even inside the house,\\\" Aikin said. \\\"He was very obsessed and stalking her, even inside her house. She was very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,\\\" Aikin said.  E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"NEW: Judge signs order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife .

President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were \\\"for the good of Pakistan.\\\"  Watch Musharraf's speech \\u00bb . There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated.  See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan \\u00bb . Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported \\\"negative\\\" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000,  said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. \\\"The situation is just unfolding,\\\" Rice said. \\\"But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable.\\\" A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be \\\"short-lived,\\\" and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. \\\"I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly.\\\" Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest. Musharraf also had Khan placed under house arrest during a government crackdown in March 2006. Asked about Musharraf's actions Saturday, Khan said, \\\"We are going to oppose this in every way.\\\" \\\"None of us accept ... this whole drama about emergency.\\\" Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto -- who arrived in Karachi Saturday from Dubai, where she had gone to visit her family -- described a \\\"wave of disappointment\\\" at Musharraf's actions.

Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are \\\"horrified\\\" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property. Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging \\\"chats\\\" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August  to September. He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called \\\"Cuties.\\\" The chat room attracts people who \\\"are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography,\\\" according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \\\"On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation,\\\" prosecutors said. In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, \\\"just delete it when you are done.\\\" A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday. He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months. He has been employed by the museum for four years, she said. In a written statement, the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer's arrest. \\\"We are horrified by the charges,\\\" the statement said. \\\"This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children's Museum family.\\\" \\\"As its essence, the National Children's Museum is about enriching the lives of children,\\\" the statement said. \\\"We are educators, child advocates and parents.

Chester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday's hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court. One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case. \\\"I think he's a little out of it,\\\" public defender Jeff Banks said. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girl's mother said on \\\"The Dr. Phil Show\\\" Wednesday that she was \\\"relieved\\\" about Stiles' arrest, although it would have been \\\"better if they found him dead.\\\" The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court. She told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching. She said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother. But, she told McGraw, \\\"I don't trust anybody now.\\\" Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls \\\"Dad,\\\" she said, \\\"I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself.\\\" Eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Asked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, \\\"Yes, I could have lived without knowing it.\\\" A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. \\\"I've had my share of nightmares,\\\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \\\"weapons enthusiast\\\" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos \\u00bb . \\\"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\\\" Thomas said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is \\\"mortified\\\" by the allegations against him. \\\"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,\\\" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim.

Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret  Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. \\\"The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum.

Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. \\\"You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,\\\" says Guss. \\\"I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes.\\\" Know your sand. \\\"In soft sand, one mile is like two,\\\" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. \\\"My favorite time is in the evening,\\\" says Guss. \\\"The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot.\\\" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights.

Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. \\\"It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,\\\" says Waugh. \\\"But it's good for the glutes.\\\" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of \\\"The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You.\\\" \\u2022 Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. \\u2022 Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. \\u2022 Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk.

Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. \\\"All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!\\\" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home \\u00bb . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. \\\"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\\\" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \\\"Five members.\\\" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. \\\"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\\\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \\\"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\\\" He pauses: \\\"But you have to miss your country.\\\" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. \\\"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\\\" says Touqan, the education minister. \\\"We will not run a parallel system of education.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status .

Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding \\\"repugnant,\\\" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. \\\"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,\\\" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. \\\"It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\\\" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president \\\"would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore\\\" it. Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. \\\"Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have.\\\" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. \\\"Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,\\\" Leahy said Tuesday. \\\"Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president.\\\" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. \\\"He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,\\\" Specter said earlier. \\\"But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president.\\\" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes.

Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry. \\\"When they cut it back on we jump for joy,\\\" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. \\\"And then you only have it for three hours.\\\" Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done.

Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. \\\"All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,\\\" Reames said.

Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2\\u00bd miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day. Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks.  See where Orme has to go for water \\u00bb . But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government. \\\"With this new water coming in, then we'll have it made,\\\" Cash said. \\\"Now we won't have to worry about it no more.\\\" In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme  on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said. \\\"We think we're going to get another 90 gallons' savings per day per household,\\\" Easter said. \\\"That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits.\\\" Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer.

The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a \\\"date rape\\\" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic \\\"date rape\\\" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. \\\"Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures,\\\" a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name \\\"Aqua Dots,\\\" have also been distributed in Australia under the name \\\"Bindeez Beads.\\\" The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. \\\"I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,\\\" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old \\\"swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time.\\\" The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since \\\"fully recovered.\\\" The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as \\\"out of stock online\\\" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning.

Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. \\\"The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,\\\" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. \\\"Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma.\\\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, \\\"They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry.\\\" Redmond added, \\\"These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state.\\\" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. \\\"We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],\\\" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.

Of a \\\"wild and gamey\\\" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, \\\"Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile.\\\" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand. About 40,000 Internet viewers  -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with \\\"Wine Library TV.\\\" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ. The mission of wine sites like \\\"Wine Library TV,\\\" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions. One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to \\\"exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,\\\" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking  -- all with attitude. \\\"The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'\\\" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. \\\"It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation.\\\" \\\"We're not afraid to be smartasses,\\\" he continues. \\\"We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on.\\\" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication. Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called \\\"Wine Burps.\\\" \\\"We love wine but hate the elitism,\\\" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. \\\"After all, it's just grape juice.\\\" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting \\\"wine hotties\\\" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software  -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer  -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines. The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle. Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having \\\"friends\\\" as on Facebook, members identify \\\"drinking buddies\\\" and check out what they're drinking. In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. \\\"They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),\\\" he says. \\\"It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine.\\\" Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves \\\"Vayniacs,\\\" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum. On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take.

Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. \\\"All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!\\\" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home \\u00bb . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. \\\"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\\\" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \\\"Five members.\\\" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. \\\"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\\\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \\\"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\\\" He pauses: \\\"But you have to miss your country.\\\" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. \\\"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\\\" says Touqan, the education minister. \\\"We will not run a parallel system of education.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status .

Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday. The number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. \\\"Nothing is going to happen. That was our first thought and we went to bed. Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,\\\" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies. The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages. Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds. In addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris.  Watch as people are left to fend for themselves \\u00bb . Low-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country. Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious. Security officials struggled to hold back the crowd.  See dramatic photos of storm survivors \\u00bb . Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974. International aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said. The United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S. Navy carriers to help in recovery operations. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. Bangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN. Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions. Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial.

Luca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. Luca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller. However, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick. The result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds.    Gianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping. Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored. Spurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box. Pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. McFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range. With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score. Scotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: \\\"We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. \\\"But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic.

U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details \\\"are still unfolding,\\\" and the threat \\\"may or may not be\\\" linked to the Saturday raid. \\\"There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,\\\" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. \\\"While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,\\\" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. \\\"I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,\\\" Djokobvic said. \\\"He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good.\\\" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for \\\"lack of effort\\\" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.

Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation . 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. \\\"Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,\\\" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. \\\"The color looks more natural and lasts longer.\\\" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation . 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites . Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to \\\"enhance your natural lip color.\\\" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26. Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores. AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie. Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22). Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14). Melissa Silver uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day. For night, she says, \\\"anyone can wear plum or sheer red.\\\" Her clients: Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger and Cindy Crawford. Day shades: Clinique Colour Surge Butter Shine in Fresh Watermelon, $14; Lanc\\u00f4me Le Rouge Absolu in Nectariche, $25.

An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ing\\u00e9nue: \\\"This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,\\\" Heigl says. \\\"I like simple hair and makeup.\\\" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fianc\\u00e9, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. \\\"I love everything new,\\\" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on \\\"Grey's Anatomy,\\\" just started a production company at Fox. \\\"When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca.\\\" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit \\\"Knocked Up\\\" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the \\\"Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup\\\" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm \\\"preparing\\\" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, \\\"I'm done.\\\" Everyone says, \\\"You just know when you put that dress on.\\\" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, \\\"Why, God? Why?\\\" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fianc\\u00e9 have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, \\\"I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl.\\\" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, \\\"I just want you to be healthy.\\\" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright \\u00a9 2007 Time Inc.

The SPAM\\u00ae Museum . SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site \\\"wall of SPAM\\\" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto \\\"Any Day Above Ground is a Good One.\\\" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of \\\"fantasy coffins\\\" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the \\\"hobo jungle,\\\" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have \\\"caught the westbound\\\" are laid to rest. 4. The M\\u00fctter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the M\\u00fctter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor \\\"Greatest Show on Earth\\\" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean \\\"enthusiasts\\\") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring \\\"mainstream\\\" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world. In 1865 Reuters was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination in the United States. As overland telegraph and undersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Europe to include the Far East in 1872 and South America in 1874. In 1883 Reuters began to use a \\\"column printer\\\" to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to London newspapers. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world, published in 18 languages. Although Reuters is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products. The company supplies news -- text, graphics, video and pictures -- to media organizations across the globe. It also provides news to businesses outside the financial services sector, as well as direct to consumers.

Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs, told reporters. The seventh fatality is believed to be a Clemson University student, he said. The six survivors -- who were treated and released from Brunswick Community Hospital -- are also USC students, he said. Pruitt said the bodies were being sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for identification.  Watch home video showing the house in flames \\u00bb . \\\"It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not,\\\" Pruitt said, explaining that several area houses were filled with college students visiting for the weekend. Newspaper deliveryman Tim Burns was aghast when he first saw the inferno early Sunday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he told the Associated Press. \\\"When I was going up to the entryway, you could hear the windows above me explode,\\\" Burns said. \\\"When I knew the flames had taken over, I don't think I've ever felt as helpless in my life.\\\" The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Pruitt said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. \\\"It just so happens, as on many university campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang around together,\\\" he said. One person described as \\\"unaccounted for\\\" was later confirmed dead, Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith told CNN. \\\"We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ocean Isle this morning,\\\" Smith said in a news conference. \\\"Nothing like this has ever happened at Ocean Isle Beach, and we hope it never will again.\\\" She said officials had not yet contacted all the victims' families, and that they were not yet releasing their names. The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the house's owner. Smith said the house was fully \\\"engulfed\\\" in flames around 7 a.m. when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after the fire department was notified.

People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and \\\"markets have come back like gangbusters,\\\" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been \\\"crushed\\\" since the beginning of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said. Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the \\\"surge,\\\" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year.  Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems \\u00bb . Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs \\\"concerned local citizens\\\" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said. Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni \\\"awakening councils,\\\" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them . \\\"From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,\\\" he said of the improving security in the area. \\\"I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged.\\\" Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a \\\"remarkable turnaround,\\\" he said. Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that \\\"we still have a lot of work to do\\\" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities. Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because \\\"essential services\\\" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a \\\"trickle\\\" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of Multi-National Division-Center, discussed a \\\"definite period of progress\\\" in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts.

Late Friday afternoon, the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path.  Watch the Santiago flames rage \\u00bb . Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if Rund, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires. E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"NEW: White truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road near time fire started .

Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. \\\"We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,\\\" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. \\\"The mother has cooperated with us,\\\" De Meo said. \\\"We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,\\\" he said. \\\"It was very sad for her to find this out.\\\" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.  Watch what's known about Stiles \\u00bb . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a \\\"survivalist type\\\" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: \\\"Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,\\\" he said. \\\"Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\\\"   The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. \\\"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,\\\"  De Meo said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's \\\"Nancy Grace\\\" that Tuck was \\\"racked by indecision\\\" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, \\\"He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter.\\\" \\\"You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,\\\" the attorney said.

But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, \\\"Actors are cattle\\\" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: \\\"I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'\\\" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film \\\"The Lodger\\\"), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand . The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as \\\"spitting in your own face.\\\" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles . When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering expos\\u00e9 of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of \\\"Citizen Kane,\\\" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: \\\"In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?\\\" Frank Lloyd Wright . As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included \\\"sleeping porches\\\" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom \\\"cubicles\\\" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dal\\u00ed . \\\"Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dal\\u00ed.\\\" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dal\\u00ed defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, \\\"The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable.\\\" Need another telling quote? \\\"At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since.\\\" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson . Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled \\\"the world's greatest entertainer.\\\" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated \\\"Paris is a Paradise for Coons\\\" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. \\\"If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,\\\" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference.

Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. \\\"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\\\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. \\\"There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,\\\" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been \\\"no decrease\\\" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. \\\"A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,\\\" he said.

It's the culture, stupid. Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him \\\"face to face\\\" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like \\\"legal\\\" or \\\"illegal.\\\" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the \\\"colonization\\\" of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would \\\"swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours.\\\" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were \\\"unassimilable,\\\" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting \\\"the quality of (U.S.) citizenship\\\" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender  Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Vannucchi reduced the deficit and Sebastian Giovinco snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Luciano Spaletti's injury-depleted team. Siena snatched a share of the spoils from Parma in a 2-2 draw as Daniele Galloppa scored in the last minute while Napoli needed an injury time goal from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to deny rock-bottom Reggina their first win of the season, forcing them to settle for a 1-1 draw in the south.

An image from a video posted on YouTube by \\\"Sturmgeist89.\\\" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the \\\"weak-minded masses\\\" and pledged to die for his cause.  Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page \\u00bb . YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by \\\"Sturmgeist89,\\\" was titled \\\"Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007.\\\" \\\"Sturmgeist89\\\" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name \\\"Sturmgeist\\\" because it means \\\"storm spirit\\\" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song \\\"Stray Bullet\\\" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called \\\"Just Testing My Gun,\\\" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word \\\"DIE\\\" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is \\\"a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. \\\"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,\\\" he wrote. \\\"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.\\\" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.  Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. \\\"After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, \\\" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

Happier times: David Trezeguet celebrates after scoring for Juventus against Torino. Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party. The 29-year-old, who last played for France in the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in September, was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He played no part as Domenech's team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month. The coach said: \\\"David is having a great start to the season with Juventus, but he's in competition for a place. If we qualify, the Euro 2008 will be in eight months. A lot of things can happen in between. \\\"I hope David will help Juventus win the Italian league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us, and that he will find his form again for France.\\\" Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his debut as a substitute against the Faroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory. Ben Arfa is joined in the squad by club-mate Karim Benzema, while Bolton's Nicholas Anelka is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury. Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury, but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. \\\"A player of Patrick's dimension is going to be missed, but we just have to accept it and get on with it. Pat should be coming to see us because he's a leader, and he's the captain,\\\" Domenech added. France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21. Domenech's team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17. If the Glasgow game ends in a draw, France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket.

Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to \\\"immorality\\\" with a \\\"sister\\\" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, \\\"I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness.\\\" Jeffs also told his brother: \\\"Farewell forever.\\\" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was \\\"covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger.\\\" In the FLDS, members call adult women \\\"sister,\\\" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and \\\"prophet,\\\" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. \\\"He is a perfectly priestly man,\\\" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. \\\"He is a man of God, and we will always love him.

A disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai. Rookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai. The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Raikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso. Raikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull. Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. \\\"I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,\\\" he said. \\\"When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. \\\"You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. \\\"We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it.\\\" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. \\\"It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,\\\" Dennis said. \\\"I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. \\\"It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference? All the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire.\\\" Alonso, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. \\\"The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure,\\\" he said. \\\"I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. \\\"I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible.\\\" Raikkonen added: \\\"We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. \\\"Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend.

Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran  is deterring potential investors . As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh: . Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation.

Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with \\\"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\\\" The group called the operation \\\"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\\\" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. \\\"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\\\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \\\"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\\\" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \\\"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\\\" \\\"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\\\" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \\\"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,\\\" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.

Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji. However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that. Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia. So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. \\\"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\\\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains: . \\\"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. \\\"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\\\" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. \\\"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\\\" says Glass, \\\"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\\\" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities: . \\\"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\\\" says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: \\\"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\\\" continues Glass. \\\"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Re-designed Fuji Speedway to host its first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977 .

Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of \\\"lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters\\\", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's \\\"principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\\\". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. \\\"It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,\\\" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. \\\"It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view.\\\" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month.

The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. \\\"There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,\\\" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of \\\"trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes.\\\" \\\"The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,\\\" Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels \\\"have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people.\\\" \\\"Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,\\\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level \\\"is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,\\\" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. \\\"We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature.\\\" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Perino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. \\\"The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,\\\" Perino said. \\\"That has to be laid at their feet.\\\" E-mail to a friend .

The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks.

Congress should cut spending \\\"and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\\\" President Bush said. \\\"The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,\\\" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana. The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in \\\"pork\\\" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. \\\"Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\\\" the president said.  Watch a report on the veto \\u00bb . While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto \\\"not responsible and not credible.\\\" \\\"This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,\\\" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. \\\"There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics.\\\" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. \\\"When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,\\\" he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a \\\"bridge fund\\\" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. \\\"Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,\\\" he said. \\\"Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible.\\\" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it \\\"the mother of all tax increases.\\\" \\\"With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,\\\" Bush said. Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a \\\"challenged\\\" housing market and \\\"uncertainty\\\" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- \\\"but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.\\\" E-mail to a friend .

The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. \\\"In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone,\\\" said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. \\\"They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50.\\\" Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. \\\"We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,\\\" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. \\\"He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. \\\"The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them.

Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become \\\"almost epidemic,\\\" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, \\\"All they told us was maybe we should move.\\\" \\\"I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details.\\\" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted \\u00bb . Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. \\\"It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,\\\" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a \\\"joke,\\\" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, \\\"I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection.\\\" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. \\\"I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,\\\" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. \\\"I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,\\\" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed. E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Some witnesses say Colorado does nothing to protect them .

The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \\\"one way or the other\\\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear \\\"intimate\\\" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours \\u00bb . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear \\\"scene setting\\\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \\\"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\\\" referring to Diana's son Prince William. \\\"I'm hoping for justice,\\\" Al Fayed said outside court. \\\"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\\\" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. \\\"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\\\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. \\\"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\\\" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident.

Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war \\\"a nightmare with no end in sight.\\\" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. \\\"I'm astounded, really,\\\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's \\\"Late Edition\\\" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. \\\"Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,\\\" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib \\\"got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch.\\\" But Graham said that \\\"finally,\\\" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, \\\"We are getting it right.\\\" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their \\\"lust for power.\\\" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. \\\"While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,\\\" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \\\"I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,\\\" McCain told CBS's \\\"Face the Nation.\\\" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but \\\"unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.\\\" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's \\\"This Week\\\" that Sanchez is simply wrong. \\\"My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,\\\" he said. \\\"I think we're making significant progress toward that end.\\\" But, he added, \\\"I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for.\\\" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will \\\"step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year.\\\" If that does not happen, he said, \\\"it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq.\\\" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. \\\"What is this? This is a colony,\\\" he said. \\\"That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter.\\\" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, \\\"No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,\\\" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the \\\"surge\\\" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents \\\"a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war.\\\" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, \\\"We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now.\\\" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq. Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. E-mail to a friend .\",\n\"Republican Sen.

PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a \\\"sanctuary mansion\\\" at his own home.  Watch the debate format produce raw moments \\u00bb . \\\"In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,\\\" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to \\\"out-Tancredo\\\" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. \\\"Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,\\\" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war.  Did  YouTubers get their questions answered? \\u00bb . Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save \\\"a trillion dollars.\\\" McCain said: \\\"It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,\\\" which drew some hoots from the crowd.  Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq \\u00bb . Paul replied: \\\"The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?\\\" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic  front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters.  Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question \\u00bb . David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, \\\"We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate.\\\" Political Ticker . Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, \\\"I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are.\\\"  Watch the candidates address gun control \\u00bb . The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: \\\"Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand.\\\" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, \\\"Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is.\\\" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not \\\"literally true in every respect.\\\" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word.  Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible \\u00bb . \\\"Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,\\\" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. \\\"If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,\\\" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal,  Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. \\\"We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,\\\" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd \\\"never met a tax he liked.\\\" \\\"I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,\\\" he said. His response was met by a \\\"Go, Fred, go!\\\" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is \\\"cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job.\\\" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month.

A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as \\\"open and transparent,\\\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. \\\"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\\\" Stone said. \\\"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\\\" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. \\\"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\\\" Stone said. \\\"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\\\"  See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls \\u00bb . By the time of their release, \\\"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\\\" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

military Jun the BBC has learned that is despite the fact that ringas are denied citizenship and are subjected to a range of discriminatory restrictions including a ban on travel outside their communities well our southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan headed is in Bangkok and told me more about what he's learned well with my burmes colleagues we've spoken to um seven different people in Five camps now you have to remember that while uh millions of ringers have left rakine State 700,000 were driven out in the Dreadful attacks on them by the military back in 2017 an operation described by the UN as possible genocide another 600,000 R remain in reine state in this very precarious situation and a quarter of those are confined to these squalled um IDP camps um they've been there since communal violence 12 years ago they can't move and we spoke to these seven people in five different camps just to confirm that this systematic constriction was going on the military government has denied it they say they're just getting ringers prepared to defend their own camps this is not what we heard we heard that the military been going around and telling the camp organizers that they must provide lists of young men ready to be conscripted uh between 15 and 25 from each Camp each time they came and these men were then selected they were told they had no choice that their families would be threatened by the military if they didn't comply they was sent for training taught out of fire guns and then thrown into battle and in rakine state where the ringas are there is a huge amount of conflict at the moment between an Insurgent Army the arican Army and the military the military has been pushed back it's been defeated there as it has been in many other parts of Myanmar and it's struggling to fill its ranks it's lost a lot of troops through desertion or through injuries and so it's simply using the ringas instead and they described horrific experiences of being thrown into these brutal battle chaotic battles uh where they suffered injuries they saw other reinges killed eventually they were sent back um to home after after the battle was over but they're sitting some of them have gone into hiding because they say that we're being told we might be summoned to go back and fight again and presumably Jonathan they they have no hope of that situation changing well they're trapped you see we we we know of lots of people in Myanmar after this conscription law was enforced in the last few weeks because the military can't get people to join the Army it's so unpopular lots of people in myama are fleeing they're either coming here to Thailand or they're going underground but these reinges are stuck in these camps they're never allowed to move anyway they're completely trapped and they're very easy for the military to go and just point a finger and say you've got to join but think of the Hideous irony here the military in particular uh does not recognize the reinges as having any legal right to live in Myanmar they've pursued these Dreadful policies against some of discrimination and outright um killings in back in 2017 they've always been regarded Ed almost as sort of UNP as people who just don't belong and yet now they're being forced to fight the military's battles and it has another bad knock on consequence because the local rakine Buddhist population the other community in rakine supports the insurgence and it's only going to inflame tensions between them and the reinges when the reinges are seen unwillingly of course fighting on the military side so it's going to store up a lot of problems to the Future it's Jonathan head in Bangkok\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

has been speaking to the BBC Christina Balon says she's still seeking a public apology for how she was treated after raising safety concerns about Tesla vehicles until 2014 Miss Balon was a rising star at the car maker in the US she spoke to our technology editor Zoe Kleinman I was the only woman in the team like engineering them and uh in the beginning was great in the early days Christina Balon was doing so well at Tesla her initials were engraved on the car's batteries but she says it wasn't long before things took a turn for the worse everything went South when I realized that they were hiding some critical safety issues she claims they pretended that they didn't know and you decided to go right to the top you went to Elon Musk himself I tried to and what exactly was the safety concern they realized that they make a design and gening mistake on the carpets you know that every the carpet that you have under the paddles and in the front of the car so what happened it's those carpets they were curling under the break and under the acceleration Christina further claims that she'd heard there were complaints made about this issue so believes Tesla was aware of it she claims that when she shared her worries Tesla's management turned hostile she lost her job sued the firm and won but then Tesla did something unexpected they dare to accuse me of serious crimes like in basment they just purely invented those with one scope in mind to give a lesson to everybody who there to speak up Tesla said in a public statement that Christina had used company resources for a secret project she denies this and the firm has never provided proof what do you want to get out of this now this this long running battle with this company I want to clear my name I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologize I battling the most aggressive type of breast cancer and uh Elon Musk and their lawyers knows that and they were willing to allow a little boy who I'm his hero for him you know I'm the mommy who does their planes and cars to let my memory of me for him be Shadow forever that her his mom sto from Tesla and I want to do something for all the cancer patients out there and especially breast cancer patient oh you're setting me off my goodness BBC News put her claims to Tesla but the firm has not responded on its website Tesla says safety is the most important part of every Tesla we design our vehicles to exceed safety standards T would have done the right thing for so many time for so many years and they did it'll now be up to the California courts to decide the

biggest cause of preventable death in the UK it kills 2third of long-term users the aim of the new bill before Parliament is to protect younger Generations from harm by Banning tobacco use for them one caller with experience of that harm told the Nikki Campbell show on BBC Radio 5 live he regretted ever starting to smoke I have to have one lung removed got empia and COPD Neal lung and now I found out got terminal cancer in me Li and adrenal glands back I yeah it's some I've got used to now I've come to terms with it but what I've gone through the last three years I wouldn't like anybody to go through you know and ever could go back I wish I never started the harm done by smoking is well documented it causes lung and heart disease cancers still births dementia and Asthma England's chief medical officer sir Chris witty supports the ban people are trapped in smoking at a very young age uh and once they become addicted their choice is taken away so if you're in favor of choice you should be against something which takes away people's choices the majority great majority smokers wished they'd never started but now they're in trouble the tobacco and Vapes Bill set before Parliament today represents a huge step change it proposes that anyone turning 15 this year and all younger Generations would be banned from buying cigarettes throughout their lives but it sparked a fierce debate about freedoms what this policy does it infantilizes future adults because when you are 18 in this country you are legally an adult and as such you should be treated like one now look at 18 you can drive a car you can join the Army you can possess a credit card you can buy alcohol and most importantly you can vote the bill also includes new restrictions to tackle concerns about the sharp rise in children using Vapes it would ensure flavors and packaging were less appealing to children but some are doubtful it will work I don't think anybody necessarily looks at the packaging and be oh let's just try that it's more that oh it's vaping it's like a cool thing to do just as smoking was in the 80s kids will be kids they will try smoking they'll try vaping the debate continues in Parliament today with where MPS will be given their first chance to vote on what would be the world's first lifelong smoking ban for younger Generations Sophie Hutchinson BBC News while that debate is continuing in the Commons and health secretary Victoria Atkins has been explaining why she wants the law to be changed we are trying to move away from this idea that um uh teenagers Uh current youngsters uh will be able to buy their cigarettes Le legally in shops uh from the age of 18 in 2027 precisely because we want to ensure that they can lead uh longer healthier lives Victoria Atkins

amongst those who addressed the national conservative event were two British politicians Nigel farage and sella bravman the organizers who were rejected by two other planned venues after a series of protests have said they'll seek legal advice miss braan a former UK Home Secretary left the conference after giving her speech she didn't stop to speak to reporters before getting in her car the local mayor had expressed concerns about Public Safety our Europe correspondent Nick beak is just in front of the venue here's what's been happening there the picture here tells the story because you can see there was this line of police officers probably about a dozen or so of them and the reason for that is that the local mayor here in Brussels has said that this event needs to be shut down so as you can see the police aren't exactly running in to Turf people out but basically the organizers of this event of this conference have been told that it has to wind down so basically in effect what's happening is that people aren't being allowed in and those leaving at the moment including Nigel farage and so and these prominent uh UK politicians they've left but they won't be allowed in along with anyone else and Nigel farage of course a lot of people will know for his role here in this city during the brexit days a leading campaigner for brexit said that this was bad decision what was happening here he said this was an attempt to stifle free speech now I put it to him what the local mayor had said in this letter that was presented to the um to the organizers here that there were potentially homophobes and people with views on other subjects including abortion on stage and in the audience and he said that was cobblers he didn't think that was the case whatsoever and he made his exits if you look through this is where the main event is and you can see possibly someone on stage there and so there are a few speeches still getting underway people have had some some food and light refreshment so this is continuing despite the efforts of the local authorities and the police to close it down so I mean what is definitely not happening is that you've got loads of police officers running in pulling people out but the the idea is that this will you know come to a halt I think it might be that for another couple of hours or so we're in this limbo the big the big question is what happens tomorrow because you've got Victor Orban the the leader of Hungary who's supposed to be among the keynote speakers to tomorrow will this be allowed to to happen tomorrow will people be allowed in the venue so yeah that's what's happening at the moment and I should say you know sort of the whole idea of this event has been overshadowed somewhat by what's been happening this was the third venue That was supposed to host it after the previous two venues uh their their hosting basically fell through the idea is that a number of politicians on the right and center right and particularly the far right across Europe are here exchanging ideas ahead of the the European elections uh in June Nick be there\"],\n [{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n

East where Israel appears to be trying to gather international support following the Iranian air strikes but has not so far at least carried out any direct military action in response instead Israel is calling for more sanctions on Iran which itself has warned Israel against attempting any retaliation following those drone and missile attacks which Iran says were a response to an Israeli attack on its diplomatic mission in Syria Chief International correspondent Lee duet has been sending us updates from Jerusalem Israel says it is now launching a diplomatic offensive the Israeli foreign minister has written he says to 32 countries around the world urging them to impose even more sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran the foreign minister Israel Katz posted this on X formerly Twitter saying Israel that Iran has to be stopped now for it is too late and that is the message that's also being sounded by Leading senior military officials here in Israel including the chief of staff leftenant General hery halvi he said that Israel would have to respond he made the comments by visiting the Neva team Airbase in southern Israel where some of Iran's missiles did actually hit in the early hours of Sunday morning although Israel says there was limited damage Israel says only a handful of missiles actually got through of the 350 suicide drones and Cru and ballistic missiles which were fired by Iran Iran says its retaliatory strike was in response to Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital Damascus on April the 1st Iran's foreign minister Amir abdan has reiterated that message in a telephone conversation with the un Secretary General Antonio gues saying that Iran acted in legitimate self-defense Iran too is calling for restraint saying it doesn't want this to escalate into a wider War we're going to look at the Peril in this moment but just to remind you that this tension takes place in the midst of the ongoing Israel Gaza War it's the 193rd day of war and today there are reports fighting in the Gaza Strip and most particularly in bet hanon in the Northeast there are also reports that more Aid is now getting into Gaza from the north we're getting reports on the ground and that is what Israel is saying that news is being greeted with relief for many many weeks now a agencies have been warning that more than half of the population of Gaza is facing acute hunger well let's now cross to the Qatari Capital Doha to join Miranda kamrava who is the director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for research and policy studies welcome to BBC news thank you leas good to be here of course you are following every uh Twist and Turn of this escalating crisis between Israel and Iran how would you describe this particular moment well the Israelis crossed the red line by attacking Iran's diplomatic compound in Damascus and then the Iranians crossed uh another red line uh by attacking Israeli soil and so we're at a very uh precarious in fact dangerous moment where we're likely to see an Israeli retaliatory strike for Iran's retaliatory strike and so the Vicious Cycle is likely to continue unfortunately this moment seems to underline the the dangerous differences in perception Iran is saying this was a very limited a very calibrated a strike it caused limited casual limited damage for Israel of course it was a reckless strike which breached its security and must there must be a retaliation and that is what is going to fuel this conflict is it not absolutely and in fact uh I think uh we do see that the Iranians did hold back they had to somehow retaliate for the attack on their uh Embassy compound and so as far as they're concerned deterrence has been reestablished and now they're saying that if Israel attacks Iran again or Iranian interests or Personnel uh there will be more of this kind kind of retaliatory strike of course netanyahu's political predicament inside Israel don't allow for restraint and we've seen Netanyahu have a penchant for overreaction he's also under pressure from the right flank of his own cabinet and so unfortunately as you mentioned we're at a precarious and very dangerous moment indeed and the speculation now seems to be that even though there are disagreements within the War cabinet and we are hearing that the cabinet may meet again today some of the former U military generals saying we should we should we should retaliate now others saying let's build our International and our regional Coalition first because they are emphasizing that this Coalition the support Israel is receiving at this moment that matters too absolutely and uh also crucial is the support that the United States will give to is Israel both diplomatically and uh militarily and we've uh heard very loud and clear messages coming out of Washington that is that the United States would not assist Israel on an attack uh uh on Iranian soil and so I think that's also given some pause to Israeli military commanders do they really want to go it alone uh knowing that Iran has this so-called axis of resistance that it can activate when it feels very threatened Marin comad thank you very much it's always good to hear your perspective no doubt we'll hear from you again as this crisis continues to unfold and as I mentioned uh during that uh discussion that we are hearing reports that the war cabinet will meet again today this will be its third meeting since uh that unprecedented attack in the early hours of Sunday morning what is absolutely clear is that uh Israel has decided it will respond but will it retaliate by attacking Iran directly that would also be unprecedented after Decades of a shadow war and covert operations will it attack some of U Iran's proxies and Lebanon Iraq Syria uh or even indeed in Yemen or will they wait and build a coalition these these are questions which matter and they matter to the Future stability at this region in the midst of what is already a very very volatile time as our world affairs correspondent at least you set there with the latest lines uh from the Middle East\"],\n [{\n            'v': 4,\n

Greece and to Olympia where the flame lighting ceremony is taking place let's have a listen in as we expect that flame to be lit in the next 5 minutes or so statues in the ancient times we'll be seeing these coroy later on waiting for us the temple we have the priestesses featuring The high priestess as well the artistic director of The Flame lighting ceremon and the choreographer emis ignu who will in a few moments time formally there she is when she strike the drum that will formally begin the torch lighting ceremony the distinguished guests LED of course by the uh [Music] this is always a very magical moment the official Olympic flame lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia of course the uh flame was lit throughout the duration of the games and that is the continuity that we're seeing in the modern era as well once this flame is lit it will not be extinguished until the closing ceremony so that the scene live in Olympia where the sacred flame for the Paris 2024 Olympics is to be lit in of course the ancient birthplace of the games there will then be the torch relay which will spread from the Acropolis to the South Pacific and as you can see hundreds of dignitaries and Spectators are there in Southwest Greece where the modern day Olympics were born in where the ceremony is held every two years for both the summer and the Winter Olympics now you can see there uh there is the Greek actress Mary Mina now she is we think going to help bring the Olympic flame to life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror beforehand it to the first torch Bearer so there is a parabolic mirror that you can see there in the middle of your shot um which we think is actually what is going to be H used to help light the flame it will then be passed to the first torch Bearer who is a Olympic rowing Champion um and then it will be handed on as it goes on the torch relay now the ceremony here in Olympia been conducted in the ruins of the 2,600 year old Temple of Hera uh as we saw in the pictures the Greek president is there as is the international Olympic Committee president Thomas back who we heard uh talking a little earlier the torch itself harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the games the tradition was revived in 19 36 for the Berlin games now uh there will be an 11 day relay of the torch on Greek soil some 600 torch bearers will carry the flame over a distance of 5,000 kilm through 41 different municipalities and areas of Greece before it is then given over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will happen um in uh April um in the late 26th is when the actual flame gets handed over to Paris so what we're seeing at the moment is this ceremony um where we expect that uh the polished parabolic mirror will be used that you can see there in the shot to help light the flame let's have a listen in for for so if you have just joined us on BBC News news we are watching live from Olympia in Greece the sacred flame lighting ceremony for the Paris 2024 Olympics it of course happens in Olympia which is the birthplace of the ancient games before that uh torch relay takes place from the Acropolis to the South Pacific there you can see the flame being walked in to the ancient 2000 600-year-old Temple of Hera uh in Greece the Greek president the international Olympic Committee president amongst the dignitaries there as of course are the officials from the Paris 2024 Games the actual Olympics will start on the 26th of July in Paris 19 days of competition but of course before that gets underway there is always the torch relay and and it starts from Greece uh where that flame will make its move during an 11 day relay in Greece itself around 600 torch bearers will carry that flame over 5,000 km through 41 municipalities before it is then handed over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will have a special ceremony as well at the site of the first modern Olympics of 1896 uh that will happen on April the 26th then of course the across France there's going to be 10,000 torch bearers that will carry the fame across 64 different French territories uh there'll be 400 towns dozens of attractions during its 12,000 km Journey both through Mainland France and also uh the overseas French territories in the Caribbean Indian Ocean and Pacific so there we see the flame being put down um ready for the ceremony for the torch to be lit in ancient Olympia for Vil [Music] [Music] the harini so for so that is Greek actress Mary Mina who is the high priestess who is now holding that Olympic torch as she moves down to light from the flame the first torch of the [Applause] relay so there we have the Olympic flame has been lit in Olympia in Greece ahead of the Paris Summer Olympics as I say the Greek actress Mary Mina now holding that Olympic flame she is the high Priestess in this ceremony and now lighting it another flame that will burn there of course there are always backup Flames whenever the torch relay happens just in case the torch does go out there is always a backup flame that it can be relit from so that once that flame is lit it will continue throughout the journey that it will take first traveling through Greece before crossing the Mediterranean to France that's going to happen in May on a three masted ship it will then travel through France and its overseas territories before arriving in Paris for the start of the games in July that ceremony is continuing in Olympia and you can continue to watch that on our BBC News website and app we have a special live feed from the ceremony if you do want to go and continue watching that flame lighting ceremony from Olympia\"],\n [{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-11 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth at some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence so we're going to start with

the bodies of Real Models meanwhile Business Insider asks whether AI will put an end to gen Z's obsession with becoming an influencer after Major Brands begin to show interest in using AI models instead of humans Mashable says a misc captioned video falsely claiming to be an Iranian missile strike on Tel Aviv was promoted as legitimate by social media platform X fake headline quote Iran strikes Tel Aviv with heavy missiles was apparently generated by X's own official AI chatbot The Verge looks at Ai and copyright in the US a new bill could force uh tech companies to disclose any

show you a bit of that later with me is priia Lani who's CEO of century Tech and artificial intelligence education technology company that develops AI powered learning tools thanks very much for coming on the program good to see you great to see you okay we're going to start now with this AI influences so artificial influence we we can take a look at um a little bit of what we are talking about so those AI influen are deep faking fake faces onto real women's bodies without permission and the the subheading there is it's a real problem is that is that how you see it yeah absolutely so the first story is about these people that are taking the real bodies of women mostly and then they're putting on a deep fake face right and then they're posting that and earning money actually from it most of the time on competitive of only fans which is a platform where essentially creators can put on their own content now in the context of only fans um more creators on only fans are women rather than men um 85% of the top 10% of earners are women and an average Creator Le just to give you a bit of context right earns about $180 a month so this is a business for some of these creators where they're you know using their own images their own bodies and creating that content and so essentially their content and their videos are being ripped off right because then you superimpose an AI face and post it elsewhere and you make money off that content so firstly you're violating personal rights yes but the second thing you're doing is obviously infringing on the the woman the creators intellectual property um and 300 people I think 300 odd odd creators have surpassed a million dollars annually earning money from from doing this so they have a very good right to be very very upset about this so it is a real problem and just just so you you get it personally this took me six 60 seconds to do actually if we can put it up on on the screen so I created one of you but actually so because there are so many tools that allow us to do this so This literally took me less than a minute actually I've done the reverse here I've got your face but I've actually changed your body yeah right you look great casual Lewis but but and so that's a bit of fern but can we have a look at it in this context so I just created this before I got here so I didn't have time to send it to the producers but if you look at my iPad leis so I took a video of you okay on BC just lift Okay so we've got you on the BBC presenting okay um a story about Tik Tok so hopefully the viewers can see that I apologize this is really last minute yeah and then uh through magic hour AI I've mashed your face with Christians Christian phrases oh my that is a terrifying thought in every way right but you see how this is you in your day job right so I've got your body I've got your I've got the BBC thankfully it stopped it stopped right so you and Christian together that's what you guys would look like um but what's interesting about that I think your your floor manager is laughing no one can hear that right now um the reason that's really important to show is that that is you in your day job and so creators are obviously creating this content you know which we we've shown um viewers and they're earning money from it so not only is it a personal affront but it's also a professional affront well and how do you you just knock knocked that up pretty quickly and pretty disturbing that's in the cab on the way here and and so how do you how do you begin to try and stop that how if it's so easy how do you how can you try and stop well and I think some of the some of the stories that we're going to come on to will help with this but obviously the input here is a an infringement right it's an infringement of Ip rights so there are laws um to protect uh copyright and we're going to talk about that in a minute in a future story but what's really important is when we're talking about this sort of generative AI okay separate it into two areas separate it into the input this is really important for the rest of how regulation and law develops in this area separate AI into the training data what was the input what data was used to train the artificial intelligence models yes and then the output what came out of the other side right now actually in the cases in the story The reason why it's just so blatant is because the output is also substantially similar right to the input okay so how do you do that well there are laws to protect in these areas is but what I find and find really really difficult is the fact that law is sometimes so expensive and difficult to access for some people so it's not actually as as Fair as saying well you know you've got recourse okay let's look at this is very very linked as you were talking Business Insider Jen's fading dream human influences are being replaced by artificial intelligence and maybe that's a good thing yeah well so so apparently a lot of gen Zed and I got anywhere from half of genz to a quarter of gened that's a lot of gen Zed want to be influencers that's the future career aspiration of of of these young people about 25% of marketers work with influencers and and again it's a job for them right so when it comes to influencers they earn a lot of money um they they create content they partner with brands for example and Brands find this really great because the return on investment from an influencer promoting your content is higher on average than if you just advertise your content so a brand would earn an average of about just over $5 in Media value for every $1 spent on an influencer so it's a huge Market but the reason why this article is basically saying your hopes and dreams no longer going to be alive right genz said is because people are using AI influencers these are completely fictitious which is what we're seeing right now so this woman here is not a real woman that's AI on top no that's AI absolutely that's yeah exactly so they're using AI to actually you know and and why right because it's cheaper right so if I can do that in a few minutes right if you're doing it where you're not substantially copying this is a different story right this is not about copying on on real pp's bodies but if you can create truly original con original output content I should say otherwise every Tech is going to have a goat me saying hang on what was the input okay but you can do that cheaper Brands can do that cheaper you don't have to pay people money you could run many characters on platforms yourself you don't have to deal with any egos that would be pretty cool right the video to me the presenter ego absolutely talking and and and so therefore this is a potential solution to that issue but I tell you what could happen right which is really interesting if you end up with AIS right out there influencing and partnering with Brands right the the most the area that most uses influences is lifestyle and second is beauty right the point is is that you trust influencers that's why they work are you going to trust an AI putting cream on their face saying my visible in my 40s lines have disappeared so actually that authenticity of the human I think will become even more valuable in the future so therefore therefore still Del a potential career path right we're going to move on to Mashable we're going to whip through a couple of these stories now Elon musk's X pushed a fake headline about Iran attacking Israel uh talk us through this because this is potential real world warning signal yeah and this is what actually people have been talking about for so long so the fact that we're just seeing it play out is actually really really sad um for for the people that have been in this space for years talking about this so essentially all that happened was that um there was content onx right that was fake news right the fact that it stated that Iran was responsible for these strikes actually that's the footage was from Ukraine I think uh launching strikes against Russians in Crimea um but anyway it was it was fake news and then grock which is uh Elon musk's big investment in generative AI um that operates on the X platform took essentially this content saw it as a trending topic made up this is an AI right made up its own headline made up its own contextualized story all fake news and then actually posted that to X users and and the problem with this obviously is it's dangerous and it reminds you of that 1938 a and Wells story where War of the Worlds right where he was on the radio and he was actually talking about martians and Aliens descending on Earth people tuned in a bit late and there was mass hysteria apparently people left their homes so how you can have an influence by posting fake news is real this is really dangerous and disinformation in fake news has to be tackled and we need to hurry up right in terms of Regulation and I mean you know ex ex is already in trouble with the EU at the moment and I think it's only a matter of time really you know for for other states to take action as well okay we're going to have a look at legislation attempts anyway The Verge a new Bill wants to reveal what's really inside AI training data so what's the attempt here yeah okay so this is very much linked to all of this right so the input data so what's happened here is Adam Schiff who is um I believe a you're going to correct me a Democrat sen Senator have I got that right but he's proposed a bill to the House of Representatives where essentially any generative AI platforms would have to list if the bill was passed so post Bill not not the current platforms with their current training data just to be clear um any copyright sources copyrighted sources that they've used to train their data models which actually gives you that transparency of what's been used right the EU already have this um in their in their drafts uh for the EU um AI act so so essentially it would it would it would put you on this Level Playing Field with the EU and the UK is saying that people in the UK saying we should hurry up as well and so it gives you that transparency of what has been the input content so when there are cases there are plenty of lawsuits at the moment for example John Grisham and a bunch of authors the New York Times has taken open AI to court it would give content creators and copyright holders the ability to to essentially check if their content has been used and if copyright has been infringed I see but it's not law yet so we keep an eye on it see how it see how it develops it's moving quickly okay uh we're going to stay in the US Texas is replacing thousands of human exam scorers with AI this is from Tech spot uh how is this going to work this is really interesting right so it does cost millions and millions of pounds in the UK dollars in the US all over the world to Mark exam scripts so they've changed the exam in Texas so that it has more long form answers so less multiple choice exact short answer and they're going to be using trained AI models to Mark students answers now before you look really skeptical okay what I would say is if you look at gcses in the UK in England for example if you look at the GCSE papers and long form answers for example in a history essay right actually it's pretty proven that marking can be a bit skew whiffing cases because you have the human marking and it can be sometimes quite subjective even if you have a rubric and a mark scheme and we've actually developed this sort of Technology at Cent as well when it comes to literacy what you do is you train your own proprietary models you don't just plug it into a GPT why because when a third party upgrades its own models actually you don't know what changes have been made and then you can see a prompt that you enter today could actually give you a completely different answer next time and then you use the exam scripts you look at the you essentially constantly have this human evaluation which is what Texas will do they've trained it on 3,000 transcripts they'll mark Mark and save lots of money and apparently need to use 2,000 people rather than 6,000 people this year but it actually is an ongoing investment because every time an exam takes place you take lots of scripts you look at the scripts where there was a low probability of those scripts being marked properly you retrain your models and it's an ongoing process very quickly that seems to make sense and I can't imagine marking script after script if you're a human teacher or exam is the most fun so that's po I bet some of them find it really fun actually I'm Jud it's an we have 30 seconds left do you want to watch some cute little robots playing football of course you do let's take a look at that right just in 20 seconds priia what's going on so essentially Deep Mind have built these mini robots playing football they use what's called Deep reinforcements learning it's a really really powerful technique in artificial intelligence where you look at all the permutations of how a football uh play might take place you reward the system or you punish it if it doesn't for example score a goal and then they're basically through Brute Force training it with tons and tons of data using deep learning as well so the technique is super interesting and here you go will will one of those be lifesized and play for Man United and help my team I don't know hopefully oh he's falling over again it is adorable when they fall over right priia amazing thank you so much we're are out of time thank you thanks Lou\"],\n [{\n            'v': 6,\n            'f': \"6\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-04 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

magnitude 7.4 earthquake there at least nine people were killed more than 1,000 others injured in the strongest Quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years more than 100 people are understood to be trapped in collapsed tunnels along the coastline and around 30 buildings are reported to have collapsed altogether our correspondent Shima Khalil reports on taiwan's East Coast the rescue operation continues in the most challenging of circumstances teams are searching for those still trapped but so much is in the way the huge destruction and the dozens of Tremors that followed I'm afraid of aftershocks and I don't know how bad the shaking will be and then the house is already a mess how do you get in there's no way to get in inan the worst hit City some people spent the night outdoors as the aftershocks continued this is the moment the earthquake hit as residents were getting ready to start their day the earthquake woke me up and we just stayed around here across from the night market it's terrible this earthquake is huge homes and businesses buckled leaving whole floors underground this partially collapsed building now left tilted and unstable threatens more damage with the continu Tremors but in taiwan's rugged mountainous East Coast it was the landslides that unleashed the most Terror the earthquake caused hundreds of them bringing huge rocks tumbling down valleys destroying roads and railway lines and blocking access to the area this beautiful landscape turned into a scene of horror and for those still trapped in collapsed tunnels and Roads that horror is not over yet shy Mahalo BBC News Tokyo let's speak to Nar Farm filmmaker who is in Taipei Nar it's good to have you with us again now since we last spoke uh what is the mood there and particularly now that there's still this rescue operation going on is that getting in the way of of feeling like there's some closure there and and the ability to move on yes um I think the people here feel quite anxious about um the rescue operation that is going on in h and um now if you know Taiwan uh it rains a lot in Taiwan and poan is not exception so today um I think that people expect a light rain there and with the terrain in palian is is going to be very difficult for rescue workers to get into the area that people are trapped um in the r um and also in mountainous areas is is also with Fallen rocks there's another danger for people to access the area um to put themselves in that risk of being squashed by by the Rocks as well uh so um people in Tai um I think feel a great Sympathy for the people in Juan they also um want the government to accelerate the effort to look for the people who are still missing uh besides that I think the life in taipe has returned to normal uh working around the city you'll see that nothing changed you know people uh don't talk much about the earthquake um they've been very resilient for many reasons and they say so uh in face of this disaster yeah that's that's really interesting you did say that yesterday that you were really struck by the resilience of the people around you clearly that's still the case uh as the aftermath becomes clearer uh they are saying that this is the worst quake in 25 years is that registering in in people's minds definitely people of older Generations all uh yesterday all talked about how they witnessed the earthquake back in 1999 um I met a man I spoke to a man who actually was in taum when the earth earthquake happened uh back then and he said that it was a huge shock um compared to it he said nothing really happened yesterday he said that you know people in Taiwan are have you know have great experience dealing with such disaster and that's that's why they feel in karma and also um there's been training there's been uh efforts by the authorities to fortify bu buildings here and create a very effective procedure to deal with disasters such as earthquake so luckily um it was uh there was no major damages to the city uh compared to the last time let's go to hen where our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes uh is there to speak to us and of course it's a City close to the Quakes epicenter Rupert uh it's good to have you on now we talked about those rescue efforts earlier in the program could you tell us uh what more we know about them yeah I can I mean here in the middle of qu and you can see what's going on behind me here they're Shoring up this building that was partially brought down by the Quake yesterday very sadly someone died inside that building uh because of the Quake they were trapped inside there yesterday here in Juan the search and rescue operation has really uh come to an end everybody's accounted for nine people are dead they're now securing the buildings and beginning the cleanup and it's been remarkable to see how quickly this city is getting back to business but outside the city uh there is a a huge search and rescue operation going on in the mountains and we've got some new figures just in the last hour the authorities are now saying 42 people missing but the number of people trapped up there in The Valleys not far away from here has left from around 100 to they're now saying over 600 646 people now confirmed as trapped probably that's because they've been able to contact people as the cell phone network has come back to life and they're calling people and finding they're trapped in hotels uh and in villages up in the mountains but that is a huge leap in the number of people trapped and a huge issue to try and get to them and make sure they're okay yeah that's a really high figure we were actually just speaking to someone in Taipei who was telling us that people are watching and following this uh what are the conversations you've been having there uh on day two of all of this well I think it's really the sense of shock still many people espe if you're under 30 years old you've never experienced anything like this before because the last time they had a big earthquake like this in Taiwan was back in 1999 so you know when you see pictures you may have seen uh you know people talking uh on TV saying I was really scared I didn't know what to do it was absolutely terrifying I think that's you know that's a very very normal reaction because a people are not used to an earthquake of this size and even in taipe yesterday it was really really a big shake and the second thing is however much Taiwan is in an earthquake zone that people say they're used to earthquakes when a big one like this hits it is absolutely terrifying and traumatizing for everybody who experiences it right riet thank you for that and of course we'll have more updates for you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 7,\n            'f': \"7\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-03

constitutional court has rejected a bid to overturn a controversial anti-gay law that is considered one of the toughest in the world the law imposes life imprisonment for consensual same-sex relationships and includes the death penalty for what it describes as aggravated homosexuality well let's go live to Nairobi and speak to our Africa reporter Esther agola Esther just bring us up today as what has happened today um uh good afternoon um so so today the Constitutional Court had its uh sittings uh just over an hour ago um and the conclusion they had was that uh as this was a matter of huge public interest um that they will not overturn the anti-homosexuality act of 2023 they did however note that the ACT did violate the uh medical rights the health rights of the LGBT plus Community um and noted that it was important um to see how to you know work that out so basically the law still stands in Uganda as per the Constitutional court today and it was rights groups that took this action to the court yes it was um and this was taken to court uh last year um and basically they were saying that it contravenes uh the human rights laws of the lgbtq plus community in Uganda to exercise um their various rights to exist to you know assemble to basically just leave their lives and we're hoping that the Constitutional Court um would overturn that but uh as it seems today um that that will not happen however the petitioners have said that they will take the matter to the Supreme Court and they are hoping that it will be overturned in its entirety yes an overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted for it what are some of the punishments for being gay in Uganda well so one of the punishments is that one can get up to life imprisonment um basically for homosexual acts um and then there's also um up to 10 years up to 14 years imprisonment for what they're calling aggravated homosexual acts um which involves rape or minors vulnerable groups um spreading of HIV and AIDS now at the time it caused quite a global outrage and indeed the US imposed visa restrictions on some officials there in Uganda has that had any effect on other lawmakers and what they feel about this um well so far uh because they say that the public sentiment um is that the law upholds the cultural rights and the cultural beliefs of the Ugandan people there's still strong support for the law to remain in place um however activists um and human rights bodies um are still calling for it to be overturn and there been there's been a lot of dismay a lot of them have called today reallying um heartbreaking homophobic and Ill informed um so moving forward it's basically just to see how the Supreme Court will listen to this cour to this case um and what are some of the issues that will emerge that the petitioners are saying um are very crucial in basically the lgbtq plus Community existing in Uganda because many have reported being attacked many have reported living in fear um as you know there's also um you know the the ACT also calls for people to report people um who are LGBT plus uh it involves renting premises it involves um registering of lgbtq plus bodies and NOS as well okay Esther AGA Africa reporter live in iobi thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 8,\n            'f': \"8\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-11 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"US President Joe Biden vows

in the Middle East President Biden has promised Israel Ironclad United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 9,\n

1440,\n            'f': \"1440\",\n        },\n\"right we're going to look now at UK US diplomacy because foreign secretary David Cameron is the latest European leader to make the trip to Washington just a few hours ago he met US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin here talks focused on well the two major conflicts bringing stability to the Middle East and the war in Ukraine now Republican lawmakers have been holding up a proposed 60 billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine for months Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson has n let the Ukraine Aid issue be debated in the House of Representatives as yet now Lord Cameron said it wasn't for foreign politicians to tell uh lawmakers In Another Country what to do but he urged Congress to see the funding released I think it is absolutely interests of US security uh that Putin fails in his illegal Invasion I think it's good for us jobs uh that we continue to back uh Ukraine with the weapons that they need and I think in terms of how the United States the United Kingdom as allies are seen around the world um there will be people in Teran in pongyang in Beijing looking at how we stand by our allies how we help them how we stop this uh illegal and unprovoked aggression and working out whether we are committed whether we're prepared to see it through and Mr blinkin said they' also talked about ways to prevent the transfer of weapons to Russia particularly from China and North Korea this is an ongoing challenge uh and we see um weapons U we also see Technologies to support the defense industrial base in uh Russia coming from North Korea from Iran from China this is an area of particular concern for not only the United States and the United Kingdom but many of our allies and partners throughout Europe let's speak now to our state department correspondent Tom baitman hi Tom so what should we take away from that pressure conference well the most significant bit of news was an answer to M that Lord Cameron gave to a question I asked him in the Press briefing there which was about the growing pressure on the UK government to Halt armed sales to Israel around the issue of whether or not Israel had been deemed by the UK to be in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza now um Lord Cameron had said on the 8th of March that he would receive legal advice within days about that issue but here we are a month later and there had still been no announcement so I asked him that question what um did the UK government deem um Israel to have done when it came to International humanitarian law and he confirmed in his answer that the UK would continue to supply weapons to Israel and therefore that a review had taken place and my understanding is these are fairly broad not just legal reviews but also policy-based reviews and under that uh the UK would continue to um uh sell uh what is around a 35 million pound a year uh trade in weapons to the Israelis but he also said that they continue to have concerns about the issue and they would continue to review it um so that was there too but that was a significant uh moment in that news briefing there okay Tom thank you very much for that going to take a look now at the issue of ukra ukine we can speak to a global Affairs analyst and Senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Michael bosu who's in Odessa in Ukraine thank you very much for coming on the program my pleasure good to be with you so let's talk about this issue of politicians going from one country to another saying well we can't tell you what to do but you really ought to do this basically Lord Cameron today in Washington urging well expressing his support for Ukraine and urging the us to do the same how do you find that balance that diplomatic balance well it was very entertaining I think Lord Cameron was being very tight lipped about his trip to Florida but I am quite sure I would bet money on it that he told Mr Trump exactly what's going to happen if that 60 billion dollar in Aid which is being blocked by his mother Republicans will not reach Ukraine and I noticed that both um ministers made the point that a lot of this money that is your mark for Ukraine is not going to be loaded on to pallets and you know airlifted to Ukraine it's actually going to stay in the United States and create jobs that's a message that the American public needs to hear but um the other quick thing that came out is I noticed uh Lord Cameron was almost ahead of his count us counterpart Mr blink in terms of his conviction in terms of his passion in terms of the arguments made for Aid to Ukraine it's almost as if the Americans were a bit hedgy about it but Lord Cameron really his message really came through that if this war is not stopped if this Aid is not delivered Putin will go further and it will become a lot more cost C for everybody and the potential hesitancy yes there's diplomatic politics at play there's Party politics at play is it simple geography as well country is far away seen as a far away problem oh yeah absolutely uh the message I got out of today more clearly than ever is that it it is now the United Kingdom and Europe that are going to take the lead on the so-called ukra file in terms of helping Ukraine for example booler their domestic production of ammunition but um the other thing that came through is I think Lord Cameron rightly tiptoed through everything because it is a very complicated Diplomat sorry political scene in the United States right now where the man who has basic control over this vote speaker Johnson I think he does support Ukraine I think he does have the votes to make that bill pass I think he knows that uh the US public support this but he's prioritizing his own political future over everything else that he wants to remain important in that Trump wing of the Republican party and what's going to happen there if he continues along this path I think people will see him as a man who could not summon the DI the political courage to do the right thing and hence this war will continue to go on for a lot longer than it has to and what do you think the implications would be for Ukraine if Trump won the presidency well absolutely horrible he views himself as the master of the art of the deal he will try to bring it to resolution in 24 hours uh leaked reports from closed door conversations he's had indicate what most of us believe is that he'll give into territorial concessions Crimea will remain in Russian hands uh the donbas other areas that Russia has seized including that crucial land bridge between the Russian Mainland and um and the western part of Ukraine and uh he'll probably um give the signals to Mr Putin that he can go even further I mean there's a lot of nervousness I have to tell you right here in Odessa we've had alarms air rate alarms uh most of the day and night and missiles coming this way it's it's not going the right way whatsoever well I just want to just very briefly just expand on exactly that because I wanted to highlight that that is exactly where you are and ask a bit about what life is like and how it is going right now a couple of things I mean I'm very close to to the port and these strikes tend to uh Target electrical infrastructure if there's no power there's no Port uh at working and there's no grain going to World Markets uh the other thing on the other side of the country in khu it's really hell on Earth um being bombed relentlessly it does look like the Russians are on an L campaign to turn it into a a piece of rubble of gry Zone and possibly even encircle it uh so very very bad news coming out of hard tonight as well Michael bosu we really appreciate your time thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 10,\n            'f': \"10\",\n

signed into law a bill lowering Ukraine's draft age by two years to 25 mobilization has become a divisive issue in Ukraine which is exhausted after two years of war and heavy losses well let's speak live to Alexa kareno who's a member of Ukraine's Parliament joins us live from adessa uh thank you so much for being here on the program your reaction to this now becoming law first of all uh hello and this law was uh voted in the parliament uh almost 11 months ago finally it is signed uh yes Ukraine needs mobilization it's clear but at the same time Ukraine also needs demobilization because some people who are fighting for the third year already and they are civilians in their previous life they can't fight forever and very important issue is the determining of term of service or Ukrainian soldiers and those who want to be changed after for example two years of fighting uh they should be changed yes so this is a big question which is now discussed in Ukrainian Society how mobilization should look like how demobilization should look like I I'll come back to wider reaction in a moment but how many extra soldiers will this actually provide because back in December president zinski was talking about the need for half a million more today president zinski said that we don't have a need half a million I can't tell you how more will be mobilized in the AG age cons conscripted in the age of 25 26 years I just don't know but we're definitely speaking about thousands of people but what is very important we can't fight with Russia by numbers we will mobilize half million they will mobilize 1 million who will mobilize 1 million they will mobilize two they are much bigger country and with a much bigger Manpower so for us the most important is to have weapons modern effective from our allies to have a smart strategy smart tactics only by these we should win or no other way there is for us but but let's bring those two thoughts together because in terms of public support for this where are we because you've had president seninsky even in the last few days talking about again the lack of weapons from the West the lack of air cover the likely Russian push in May and June families ordinary families will be alarmed to be sending their 25y olds to war weren't they they will for sure and definitely that's a hard topic and um everybody who wanted to go to fight voluntarily they did it in 2022 so now we're speaking about people who don't want to fight but today yes some of them understand that they need to fight to protect their country some of them try to avoid these this is to also reality so my personal position is we need to have very clear and simple system when it is absolutely clear for example 18 months of service you know definitely how more alone will you serve you know that you will have rotations so you will not be all the time on the front line you know you will have vacations and all of this but once again we really I want to address you and those who are listening to us and watching us now Ukraine needs help in weapons now in ammunition now we don't have lack of people but we have lack of support from our partners who promised us to be with us as long as it takes and now it is not happening\"],\n [{\n            'v': 11,\n            'f': \"11\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-21 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Reddit share sale values

or IPO and if you're not familiar with Reddit it hosts Niche discussion groups or subreddits around a 100,000 of them on everything from politics to pets investing and hobbies in the world of Co in the words of co-founder and boss Steve Huffman Reddit topics range from the sublime to the ridiculous the trivial to the existential the IC to the serious around 73 million people use it every day so what's it worth Reddit has priced its shares at $34 giving it a stock market value of $6.4 billion at the start of trading that could of course go up or down once shares start trading but it is well below the $10 billion valuation given to Reddit by investors back in 2021 and to put all that in perspective social media giant meta which owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp was worth $1.2 trillion at the market close on Wednesday let's go live to Paul condra he's head of industry and Technology research at pitchbook which provides data on the global Capital markets and he's in Seattle Port Reddit may not be as famous as Facebook Instagram or X but it has 1.2 billion subscribers and an oversubscribed public listing so it's clearly a hot ticket is it scalable though can it reach the heights of those bigger companies uh well yeah I mean thanks for having me I think if you look at the daily active user count it's much lower than some of those larger properties you mentioned at about 70 73 million versus you know up into the billions for a company like meta and I think it caters to a much more Niche um type of use case um and the type of contributors and moderators that kind of want to run their subreddits um the way they see fit and they want to have more control over it whereas when you look at a you know a Facebook or an Instagram it's much more centrally managed so it's it's a different kind of business model um and I think it draws people in slowly but it also draws a lot of people in um that maybe want to get information quickly and get out because the kind of stickiness factors that exist in uh some of these larger platforms don't really exist in Reddit so yeah the opportunity really is you know how much do they want to go down that road of trying to use some of the techniques and models that some of their larger counterparts are using to make the platform stickier to make it a little more of an entertainment type of platform bring users in and try to monetize it a bit more effectively than they have in the past exactly I mean Paul you mentioned its business model and the fact that it needs to monetize it it doesn't make a profit it hasn't made a profit we've got a more competitive advertising Market it's signed this $60 million reported deal with allowing its data for training Google's AI models it's obviously got very valuable data from these discussions but I mean how is it going to raise the bottom line yeah I mean the the the the model was never really built to optimize advertising right it was built to provide a platform for creators and contributors and moderators kind of a decentralized um conversation space where people can be kind of have free reign on the things that they want to talk about and now so there now there's a bit of a pivot taking place uh for a company that wants to go public and wants to optimize that platform more effectively um they just raised a lot of money so that means they've got some Capital uh or they will have once this IPO is completed um they don't have any debt uh and so they've got the ability now to invest in the resources to say look we've got the traffic we've got the platform um but we don't really have is an advertising machine that really is optimized and capitalizes on that on what we have there so we can put the people and teams in place to start investing on that and they probably can make progress are they going to be able to grow it faster or take a bigger share of the market from their bigger competitors probably not but they can they can most likely turn that into a stronger business than what it is now um and then there's these secondary revenue streams that they're they've made some progress on which is selling the data um and that's become obviously very important in the last couple years with the rise of generative Ai and they have a pretty unique um data set a lot of IP on unique um valuable information across all these subreddits uh it's already proven to be somewhat valuable to Google who signed kind of a $60 million deal with them this year that can be an interesting Revenue stream probably a much higher margin Revenue stream I think there's a lot of questions around how big that can be but if we're just looking in the next couple years I think there's a lot of reasons this company can kind of put the pedal down in terms of generating more revenue and increasing the margin profile and and those are things to get people or at least get investors excited when you look at a valuation that's coming to the market that's not terribly expensive um to say hey this could be a good run for the next couple years it's probably not going to reach the scale of meta um but could be a good solid business if they're able to execute on those plans right and I guess they'll be watching out very closely for whether it affects the user experience at the same time Paul condra thanks so much for joining us\"],\n [{\n            'v':

and that the strikes were a limited Act of self-defense our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has the latest Israel is deciding how to respond to this hundreds of drones and missiles fired over the weekend from Iran damage on the ground was limited damage to Regional stability much more severe at an air base hit by missiles in the neav desert today Israel's Chief of Staff promised a response Iran will face the consequences for its actions we will choose our response accordingly the IDF remains ready to counter any threat from Iran and its Terror proxies Israel says only a half handful of missiles made it through air defenses but this direct confrontation with Iran the First on Israeli soil has thrown the Middle East off balance what's shaken Israel in these attacks isn't the damage caused but how they happened with drones and missiles sent straight from Iran and what these strikes left broken isn't so much infrastructure it's Iran's fear of launching a direct attack Iran's attack came with careful signaling its government warned Israel's allies of the strikes and said they were punishment for an assassination in Syria and that Iran now considered the matter closed our advice to all the supporters of the Zionist regime is to appreciate Iran's responsible and measured action and dissuade the Zionist regime from committing more wicked acts which would bring incalculable consequences but Israel has said it will exact a price from Iran its prime minister under pressure from allies to deescalate the situation has been discussing with his War cabinet exactly what that price should Beal one former Diplomat with experience of Iran says military action is only one option our military options are far more varied than the Iranians um and frankly the Iranian uh barrage was a a demonstration of weakness not of strength there's clearly uh a strong need for Israel to uh however it decides to respond and the respond can response can come in many different ways not just military Israel is already fighting iranian-backed groups in Gaza to the South and Lebanon to the north a far less powerful opponent delivered a major blow on the 7th of October Israel's challenge now is how to restore a fear of conflict in its biggest enemy without triggering a war Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem our International editor Jeremy Bowen is here so as we heard Jeremy Israel continuing to insist it will retaliate even while the US is saying Iran has embarrassed itself well I think they're trying to get the message over to the Israelis that look yes your right to be concerned you have been attacked but this is under control look Iran's embarrassed itself it's not that simple though for the Israelis uh I think they feel the need very strongly to send a signal a really determined signal that they uh are not deterred in any sense by Iran there's something very deep in Israel's DNA that it has to push back it's not a question of turning the other cheek it's an eye for an eye at least uh that is something which is really part of their ethos but the gamble is always how is the other side going to respond because as you've heard the Iranians are also saying hang on this was self-defense we were just doing it to make a point also to restore to Terence and I think what they were also trying to do was uh to avoid making causing a large numbers of Civilian casualties which would have escalated matters so Israel is having those same similar kinds of discussions about the way that they need to go the Iranian Army Chief has said today in the last few hours he said something like our attack on Israel was limited if Israel retaliates there will be a far greater response you know from netanyahu's point of view for many years he has seen Iran as Israel's number one enemy bana I remember him saying to me in the BBC office in Jerusalem about about 2006 when armad was President he said look armad had is Hitler and it's 1938 you know it wasn't an exclusive he was saying it a lot at the time to people but that's very much his view now don't forget there's also the war in Gaza going on that's something which is still urgent it's still there's still the famine there is still military action going on there in the middle part of the Gaza Strip but as far as Israel's uh Western allies are concerned it is less of a priority these last few days than Iran Iran seems a lot more urgent doesn't mean to say that they've forgotten about what's going on there but instead of talking about differences potential war crimes famines they're talking about Unity coalitions facing Iran together\"],\n [{\n            'v': 13,\n            'f': \"13\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-15 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Corals turning white and dying after record

Administration in the last few minutes it's announced what it calls the fourth Mass Coral bleaching event is already underway well this is what's at risk mile after mile of coral reef slowly turning white or even dying out altogether by some estimates around 50% of coral has been lost in the last 20 years well let's get more on this development speak to our science reporter Georgina Renard who's in in The Newsroom for us and Georgina welcome here to the program this seems quite a disturbing new report bring us right up to date yes that's right so what this these us officials are saying is that we're now in the fourth Global Mass Coral bleaching event the first one was in 1998 and we've had two since then and now we're in the fourth one now what this means is uh Coral is is this very sensitive animal it lives often in Shallow Waters but when the water it's living in gets too hot it gets stressed it expels an algae that lives inside it and then it can turn white and often it can die and this is interesting also because we've been seeing for months these broken climate records ocean heat driving up and really seeing unprecedented levels of of warming in the oceans that's partly driven by climate change or mostly driven by climate change and also by El Nino this natural climate fluctuation that started last year we've been reporting on those broken records for months but this is now the first really solid Global evidence of just what that heat is doing to the oceans and to this really fragile sensitive ecosystem and these wreaths Coral build these vast cities underwater they're sometimes called the Seas Architects and inside those wreaths live a quarter of all marine life so this isn't just about these these amazing animals it's also about the rest of us our fishing and also the uh the income the trillions of dollars that coral reefs generate around the world and Georgina we're seeing coral reefs in all their Glory with all their colors but once the bleaching starts is there any way that it can be stopped or reversed that's one of the strange things the pictures actually look quite beautiful but scientists say up close when they dive in the water the coral is decaying and they can see it sort of coming apart unfortunately this is once the coral starts to to bleach um it's very difficult to turn back if it's given enough time it can recover but it needs one to even five years to get to get better and in that time it's quite susceptible to disease if there's enough time between these heat episodes it can get better um but at this rate that seems unlikely there are some local Solutions so some coral reefs um have had some successful restoration um they have managed to create some Coral that is resistant to these higher temperatures but all the sign scientist I've spoken to to prepare for this story they said that it's really a case of adapting to a future with a different type of coral and much less of it rather than really being able to save all of the coral reefs across the world's oceans now in previous bleaching events how much of the world's coral reefs were were actually lost so it's it's very difficult to tell exactly how much Coral uh mortality there's been that would require scientists to go to every single piece of coral reef in the world in the last episode which was 2014 to 2016 more than half of the world's uh corals were in waters that were too hot and in some areas we saw 25% 30% up to 50% mortality this episode that these us officials have just declared uh is still ongoing and they're saying they do expect that bleaching to surpass it and just one of the things to think about is that Coral provide this amazing home some of the sounds that they make that amazing creaking and almost singing H it's vital to the to the fish that that live in in the waters and when the fish actually use that creaking to find their way home and when the coral dies the fish lose that sound that's sort of the siren that takes them back uh and so what we see when the coral dies is fish and other animals can no longer find that way back to the these huge reefs that they call their home Georg we have to leave it there but thanks for bringing us right up to date on that breaking new report\"],\n [{\n            'v': 14,\n            'f': \"14\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-16 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Sydney

Orthodox Church on Monday was a terrorist act a teenage boy was arrested after a bishop and several churchgoers were stabbed while giving a sermon that was being streamed live online at least four people were stabbed but police said none of their injuries were life-threatening while the commissioner of New South Wales police explained why they are treating the attack as terrorism the things that influence my decision to declare this a terrorist incident was the actions of the individual who attended uh we we will alleged attended that church uh with a knife armed with a knife and uh stabbed the bishop and priest and others were also injured we believe there are elements that are satisfied in terms of religious um motivated extremism and of course the intim ation of the public through that person's acts well prime minister Anthony albanesi called for Unity in the wake of those attacks this is a disturbing incident there is no place for violence in our community there is no place for violent extremism we are a peace loving Nation this is a time to unite not divide as a community and as a country so let's talk now to our austr correspondent Katy Watson who's in wakeley the western Sydney suburb where the attack took place Katie good to have you with us and so police describing and declaring that attack as a terrorist act um what has been the reaction where you are well you can see behind me there are forensic teams still working um in the car park it's a crime scene um so it's still very early on uh in investigations um but this was you know attack that took place just two days after um the brutal stabbing in the shopping center in Bondi Junction and people here were really I mean you tensions are certainly High um what we saw last night was of course the stabbing that was live streamed and because of that there were crowds that quickly descended here um you know hundreds and hundreds of people came um outside and stood outside uh this church and at some point they turned on police uh there were police injured at one point paramedics and police were bar had to barricade themselves in the church um and and keep themselves inside um police have also said um that the attacker um had tips of his fingers cut off they're unsure whether that was self-inflicted or it happened in in the in the in the the riot situation certainly um you know all of this is currently being investigated so an awful lot really to to to digest and to try and get their heads around obviously the attack but also so the confrontations that we saw afterwards yes and we know the Prime Minister um convening that emergency meeting uh also uh urging people not to take the law into their own hands referring to some of those those protests and some of that unrest uh that unfolded there um but as you touch on there these two attacks in short succession in Australia I wonder what the general feeling is across Australia right now and whether there is a feeling of nervousness given what has happened and unfolded well certainly I mean obviously the tax aren't connected but speaking to people here there's a feeling that um what we saw last night was a trigger if you like trauma for many of the community who have uh fled countries like Syria and Iraq um to come to what they thought was a safe place uh and I think that's something that they it was an attack on their religion it was an attack in the church um and and of course tensions there you know Rose so there's certainly that that discussion is going on about how safe Australia is and that is replicated across Australia you know the the conversation I've heard time and time again in these last few days is this sort of thing doesn't happen in Australia but we've seen it happen and we've seen it happen twice in the last you know in in less than a week Katie for now thank you Katy Watson there live in Sydney for us thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n

time for our new weekly segment AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence we're going to start with a Guardian newspaper it says according to Israeli intelligence sources Israel's military has been using an AI tool known as lavender to identify Hamas targets across Gaza Israel has rejected this and has released a statement which reads the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives next we have an opinion piece in the new Statesman why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence it asks whether existential anxiety about AI is just the patriarchy's fear of itself in a few minutes uh we see a robot called sfia respond to a question about how AI can come up with a road map to a more Equitable Society the Ft reports the US and the UK have signed a landmark agreement on artificial intelligence are becom the first countries to formally cooperate on how to test and assess risks from emerging AI models in the Wall Street Journal is the internet big enough to satisfy the huge appetite for data the world's leading AI companies need to grow the times reports more than 200 musicians asking technology companies to stop using their songs to train artificial intelligence models artists like Billy ish and RM are warning the music ecosystem is at risk of Destruction and finally are you ready for your fast food to be cooked by robots a US convenience chain says it's installed an AI powerered robotic system to give customers quote fully customizable fried chicken french fries and other items we'll show you that later with me is Stephanie hair technology author and AI commentator Stephanie great to have you as always uh should we start with a very sobering story on the front of the Guardian newspaper yes so we are looking at a new frontier in the field of warfare which is and it must be said that the Israeli Defense Force has denied this story but in the story which claims to site six Israeli Intelligence Officers who've all used a system called lavend to identify human targets and that's not particularly new the IDF has been using AI to identify buildings and structures as targets that was a system called The Gospel this new system though is called lavender and the differences rather than picking a build a building to attack or blow up they're going after humans so the question becomes who's responsible and who's making these decisions and is there proper human oversight the article would suggest not these six Intelligence Officers in the story claimed that they were spending about 20 seconds maximum to approve the targets that the AI was deciding for assassination that's time time scales will raise some eyebrows certainly just want to bring you the response quoted in the Guardian newspaper from uh the Israeli Army the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist adding information systems are merely tools for analysts in the Target identification process right let's move on to the front of the new Statesman this is one of those headlines isn't it why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence is strong enough but then the sub headline there existential anxiety about AI is just patriarchy's fear of itself Stephanie talk us through this I mean as a feminist this is a particularly enjoyable article to read but then with my British sense of fair play I had to go hm are we really saying that AI would be better designed if it was only being designed by women for instance or only people who are left-handed or only Americans versus peruvians so we have to really ask what is this article arguing for so it says you know projection is a mental process by which people attribute to others what they would actually do themselves so when you have a bunch of male billionaires the article argues not me I should say worrying about existential risk and domination the author makes the analogy that that's really because that's what an Elon Musk would do or that's what a Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg would do but it's not necessarily what all of us would do and hopefully not what a diverse inclusive team would do so it's really a call for diversity interest and that's real psychology isn't it it's basically going inside the brains of these people who are in charge and thinking what they're most scared of is a projection of their biggest weaknesses is and so therefore it's power and domination and so you've made the caveat that this not you where where do you stand on that as a as a theory though is it something that I mean presumably you're going to support diversity in of the people making these big decisions yes but not in a sort of politically correct woke way that some people might get very nervous about I'm actually looking at it in the perspective that we have here in this country with gchq which is neurodiverse teams more diverse teams perform better than monocultural teams because they see the world differently and in the domain of cyber security which is what gchq is all about keeping the country safe you need different perspectives to identify risk okay so it's a danger to just have group think I see okay well we know what the article thinks we now know what you think should we see what AI thinks now Bloomberg did a series where they asked a an AI robot Sophia um a series of questions one of them was how to make an AI system more Equitable potentially let's take a listen come up with a road map not just with a goal but with a road map for a more Equitable uh Society AI definitely has the potential to contribute to a more Equitable Society but it requires a collective effort and the inclusion of diverse perspectives we need to set ambitious goals for AI that prioritize issues like causing Global fairness and climate impact a road map can guide us towards achieving these goals and ensuring that AI serves the greater good Stephanie I don't want to say you could be replaced but that answer sounded a lot like the your answer I don't know what that means I don't know who came up with it first it might be a trained off of my book well good point good point right let's move to something potentially really important we've been following legislation attempts at regulation of course uh over the weeks and months us and UK signed Landmark agreement on testing safety of AI this is in the Ft what's this about I love this story it's all about how the US and the UK always want to be the first at having a safety Summit and now they're the first to agree that they're going to test AI but then you actually go into the article the United States AI safety Summit has actually done no work on this since the summit that we had back in November so they're signing lots of stuff but nobody's doing anything when you actually look into it they don't have the budget or the staff yet I'm sure the United States has other things going on so we can feel that this is hopeful but are we reassured I would say the jury is still out on this but it's still exciting to see countries committing to it and other governments will watch and the idea is I was at Bletchley Park for the for the UK and the signing and the announcements and the Great and the good were there and the idea is that rather than let private companies develop all this AI on their own actually they'll hand it over and so that the governments or government people uh who they're appointing can have a look inside and check it's actually safe is that right yes and the idea is that the US needs to be involved it can't just be the UK because most big AI companies or companies using AI are American but we have to acknowledge China is not anywhere involved in this agreement nor was it really involved with the summit very much and that is an AI superpower so again no resting on laurels when it comes to AI safety and as a principle do you think this model is going to be enough because like you say at the moment you're skeptical of resources and and uh time spent on it so far but let's presume that that does all come the agreements continue and they work together is it enough to warn and warn off the potential worst downsides of AI I would argue no we've got the EU AI act coming on quite soon the finalizing of that's happening this spring and a couple of years implementation that's a start but you know there's no rush to regulate here in the UK there's no rush to regulate in the United States so how are people going to be able to Sue how are they going to be getting responsibility and liability for when AI goes wrong and that's just in in the countries I've just listed AI is a global phenomenon it's like public health or climate change is going to have to involve every country on earth I think we're just at the beginning of building our AI sa safety infrastructure and just very lastly and quickly on this because you me things like China now China were invited I remember to BL part to day one of the summit but not today to when they've really talked about more sensitive things how do you see China and other countries working with China well right now it's very awkward because China keeps stealing people's data and launching cyber security attacks and then getting caught for it so it's hard to work with them and have trust at the same time they can't be left out of the discussion we're constantly working to find common ground with them and we must respect the work that they're doing some of it's very impressive interesting right let's move on to Wall Street Journal because this is interesting for data guzzling AI companies the internet is too small what what does that mean the internet is too small I love that it's like you know water water everywhere and not a drop to drink this is you think the internet has loads of data and you think that the world existence not just human but all of it is something that could be datafied and it could but it hasn't yet and that's what this article makes so beautiful most of the data available online is useless for AI training because it contains flaws it's not structured properly um this researcher who's quoted thinks that it's about a tenth of the information gathered is useful most of what's on the Internet is garbage who knew wow and so is there any kind of solution of course um there's going to be a whole field some of the most Cutting Edge research is going to be looking to structure data to create synthetic data which is where it's actually generated from within a company rather than going out and getting it and extracting it we are again on the cusp of this so I love that we've identified the problem it the problem answers with a solution we will have a new field being created interesting well that feeds into this next story which is something again we are going to continue to return to musicians from Billy eish to AR M unite to demand protection from AI so this is AI going out and crawling the internet and these artists these musicians want it to stop well I mean quite and it's not just musicians it's actors it's it's writers whose books might be being copied and turn into Bloomberg videos you just don't know do you because there's no real regulation there's no playing field on this so right now you've got the New York Times suing Microsoft and open AI saying you can't train on the New York Times so until we get a couple of loss suits that finally make a decision that's one way of solving it or we can have what the musicians are asking for which is kind of like a good behavior pledge that always works very well um right or we could get some actual laws passed so again let's see how it plays out and specifically on the music then you've got AI going out and listening to Billy eish or whatever and and using that to do what to try and come up with his with its own songs so many things so you could be impersonating a singer so like take take a great song like Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin and give me the version as sung by Dolly Parton which I would love to hear by the way so you could do that but does Miss Parton get paid for that does le zeppin get paid for that did they have consent in that Etc somebody could put that on the internet and I'm sure will right now after putting it out right like it'ss just that quickly uh that you can do this so that's one thing but it could also be training off of their lyrics and even off of their musical composition and Arrangement which is that's their proprietary product and and so is the is the potential end game I don't know whether it is anyone's end game that but that it could learn AI would learn all the different styles off all the different artists out there and then basically just keep on generating its own music and we would go on to whatever our music playlists are and just listen to AI generated stuff and we don't need any well I think it could get quite derivative it's sometimes like when your favorite band maybe goes on too long and needs to stop touring it could just sometimes they have a golden period and you wish they'd stopped no I'm I'm not commenting on any of that right we've got one one last article to look out this is The Verge now there's an AI gas station with robot fry Cooks uh we'll take a look at it in action whilst you explain what's going on so okay okay sorry so this robot is g to be making your chicken wings for you to be honest it can make any food and Fries um obviously there's not going to be any fun banter with this chef but efficient and in theory controlled product every time so you would be able to get the same thing if you gave it specification I wanted Cajun I wanted jerk chicken I wanted you know tender um dark meat only Etc so why is that interesting fully customizable fried chicken and french fries I mean don't get me wrong I love both of these things dearly a the the realm of variety isn't as big as you'd think and B do you need a robot for that is that a problem that needs solving is that a problem that needs solving that's a good question to end on I'm afraid we are out of time Stephan thank you so much we are out of time we'll do the same again next\"],\n [{\n            'v': 16,\n            'f': \"16\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-29 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Evan Gershkovich: One year since Russia jailed the US

in Russia Mr gershkovich is the first American to be charged with spying by the Russian authorities since the end of the Cold War the US government and the Wall Street Journal have dismissed the charge they say Mr gershkovich is being used as a bargaining chip by Moscow well I'm joined Now by Dr gulosa s from the committee to protect journalists and independent non profit organization that promotes press Freedom uh Dr s thank you very much for your time what's the the latest information first of all that you have on how Evan is doing thank you for having me uh today is the first anniversary since Evan gich is detention in Moscow on absolutely bogus charges and just a few days ago on March 26 the Russian authorities extended his detention by another three months which means that he's going to stay in pre-trial detention uh until unless uh until the end of uh June and uh then we are hoping uh that the trial will start but he is accused of Espionage as you said and this is a very heavy charge and Espionage charges uh usually end with conviction in Russia so he's very likely to be convicted he is looking into up to 20 years in Russian jail what do you read into that extension of the pre-trial detention though rather than moving closer to the actual trial could it indicate that conversations to try to uh free Evan gershkovich are actually uh making some progress or at least are remaining very active I hope they are remaining uh very active and I hope that we're close to the moment when he will be uh released and uh return to the United States and uh to his family to his parents and sibling but uh everything we know from previous Trials of journalists accused of Espionage uh is that usually uh pre-trial detentions are very long uh followed by trials uh hel held behind closed doors so I think the most likely scenario is that Evan is tried and convicted first before the US and Russian authorities agree on the prisoner exchange how difficult is it for journalists in Russia at the moment to to go about their business to work given the the current climate look it's never been easy to be an independent reporter in Putin's Russia Putin has been uh in power for close to a quarter of a century and from the beginning he made it his goal to control the flow of information uh but until Evan's detention a year ago uh foreign correspondents who worked in Russia although knew they were at risk they probably didn't expect some something as harsh as ESPN charges uh because we know of other cases of journalists including uh BBC correspondents who were not very who did not feel very welcome especially after Russia started its full SC invasion of Ukraine but with evans's case the Russian authorities uh send a signal that nothing is uh beyond their whims beyond their control and everything is possible as you know evans's case is the first case of an American journalist uh charged with Espionage in Russia since uh the end of the Cold War so now every journalist foreign or local is at risk of immediate imprisonment uh in Russia okay Dr gulosa s from the committee to protect journalists joining us from New York thank you very much thank you\"],\n

cooperation between the two countries top of the agenda of course in the background tensions with China never far from the mind with well a number of Western governments right let's take a look at what's been happening there we go President Biden is hosting Japan's prime minister fumio kashida there at the White House there have been military guards of Honor they also be a state dinner in the next couple of hours now the talks are part of the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts in Asia there were recent war games in Soul and take a look at these pictures this is the weekend the US Japan Philippines and Australia held joint military exercises in the South China Sea the Chinese military conducted combat Patrols in the same area and speaking a little earlier President Biden said Japan the US and Australia will together boost military capabilities including uh through the creation of an air missile Network Biden said the upgrades were defensive in nature this is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of since it was first established I'm also pleased to announce that for the first time Japan and the United States and Australia will create a network system of air missile and defense architecture we're also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom and our Aus defense partnership with Australia in the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar which focuses on Advanced capabilities including AI autonomous systems all told that represents a new Benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities right let's speak to Mary mcarthy professor of political science Drake University specializing in Japan's domestic and foreign policy thank you very much for coming on the program thank you so much for having me right there were lots of words that Joe Biden was just saying trilateral capabilities uh lots of other slightly jargony technical missile capabilities can you please attempt to explain that for us well I think the to start off we have to say that the meeting this week between Biden and kashida coming on the heel of these military exercises that were just mentioned is extremely important it is a signal to both domestic and international audiences we know that one of the target audiences is certainly China but it's not only China it's the International System in general as well as domestic audiences in the US and in Japan and and so I think that the second important thing to really highlight is that the announcements today are not coming out of nowhere out of the blue they are the culmination of months of hard work by the Biden and kishida administrations as well as the governments in Australia in the Philippines and elsewhere and so this is so let's just focus on on exactly that the mention there of Australia the mention of uh the UK Britain will hold regular joint military exercises in the Indo Pacific with the US and Japan from 2025 uh to boost Security in the region that's from the uh Ministry of Defense here in the UK that role with Australia too as well as Japan where does all this leave China so I think it has become increasingly clear that so-called likeminded states in the Asia Pacific are cooperating and coordinating more closely certainly on defense and security but also on what is now called Economic Security resilient Supply chains closer economic relationships and we see Japan and Australia both taking clear steps to be in lock step with the US with regard to its position in the Asia Pacific and seeing China today as a strategic challenge or perhaps even a strategic threat whereas previously there was a lot more efforts on the part of Japan and Australia to enhance the partnership elements of their relationships with China yeah lots of uh political discourse based around the difference between the world word challenge and threat we haven't got time to go into that now because I want to talk about space that was mentioned astronauts us Japan cooperation is this something we should read anything into it is I think it represents two important elements of the US Japan relationship one is that the relationship is multifaceted it is not only a security relationship it is not only an economic relationship there are so many issues on which the US and Japan are should and could be cooperating and space is one and the second important thing to keep in mind is that space is not something frivolous oh oh it'll be great the Japanese astronaut will be on the Moon yes that's wonderful it will be exciting for the Japanese public to see but it's really important to keep in mind that space is an element of International Peace and security and that us and Japan cooperating in space is also an element of their defense and security relationship okay Mar mcarthy thank you very much for coming on the program thank you thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v':

from their homes cities under threat evacuations ongoing while the flooding in the urals and Western Siberia has been caused by unseasonably warm temperatures which has melted the snow in the Russian city of orenberg home to half a million people The Authority said water levels had reached dangerous levels thousands of people have already left the city orenberg is Downstream from the city of os which was inundated when a dam burst last week well let's go straight to Moscow and straight to our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg and Steve just give me a sense of the scale of this first of all well the first thing to say is that uh spring flooding is common right in in Russia um when winter turns to Spring and and the snow melts we see flooding but nothing on this scale I mean and it's beyond Russia right in you mentioned Kazakhstan 97,000 people have been evacuated from the flood zone in Kazakhstan uh as for Russia more than 12,000 people have been evacuated uh from their homes uh you mentioned orenberg I think more than 7,000 people have been evacuated from from orenberg and uh boats have been uh uh sailing around the city there um Sirens wailing uh people being called on to to leave leave their homes in in different districts uh of the city so the scale is quite big uh and there's an economic consequence here too um as far as we know casualty figures are low at the moment uh I've heard maybe four or five people have been killed over the last few days uh in this flooding but uh it's flooding which has affected lots of communities lots of settlements in the area of the Ural M mountains and Western Siberia we're seeing pictures aerial pictures of just the huge amount of territory that this flooding is actually uh actually hitting and impacting are the water levels still Rising talk me through the amount of help people are getting on the ground the water levels as far as we know are still Rising uh in orenburg uh and in fact uh President Putin spokesman de pesov uh earlier today um said that the situation was expected to get worse in other places water levels have fallen for example in the the town of Ork that you mentioned it was quite interesting a few days ago uh a crowd an Angry Crowd gathered in Ork to uh vent their Fury uh on local officials on the regional governor of orenberg on the local mayor uh who they believe didn't warn them in time that this flood was coming uh they criticized Russia's Minister for emergency situations too they didn't criticize the Kremlin which is quite interesting they were actually chanting Putin help us Putin help us as if you know the president sitting in the Kremlin in Moscow was the goods are in according to Russian tradition some that they believe could actually help uh solve their problems give them compensation uh make things better exactly on that point with Vladimir Putin has he said anything about this himself directly we see him so vocal on International matters the operation in Ukraine what about something like this domestically with people calling for him to step in have we heard from him at all so the official message uh from the Kremlin is that Vladimir Putin is across this completely he's being in kept informed he is uh dealing with the situation coordinating the situation um we haven't seen that yet we haven't seen the pictures of this and there's no suggestion at the moment that Vladimir Putin is going to visit uh the flood the flood area um at the moment um the message is being put out there that the president is in full control of the situation but we haven't actually seen evidence for that Steve Rosenberg live there in Moscow thanks very much for that thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-10 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

Jennifer Crumbley are the first to be held responsible for a gun attack carried out by their teenage son Ethan Crumbley killed four classmates and injured seven others in 2021 at the Oxford High School he's serving life in prison without parole his parents were both found guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter and face 10 to 15 years in prison each of the defendants gross negligence has caused unimaginable suffering to hundreds of others as a result of what happened that day each Act or inaction created a ripple effect therefore an out of guideline sentence is appropriate and proportional the court uses the youthful useful tool of the legislative guidelines which embody the the principles of proportionality while also taking into account the nature of the offense and the background of each defendant I believe that the following sentences would be in the best interest of justice and are reasonable and proportionate to the seriousness of the matter and the circumstances surrounding each defendant with regard to Jennifer Crumley it is the sentence of this court Miss Crumley that you sered 10 to 15 years with the Michigan Department of Corrections to defendant James Crumley it is the sentence of this court that you serve 10 to 15 years years with the Michigan Department of Corrections well let's speak now to Kim bware who has been following this story for the Washington Post Kim thank you very much for joining us um as we said a landmark case what's the reaction been to the sentences I think this is the sentence that the families the victims family members had wanted and this is a sentence that for a lot of people in this community do feel is the right one given the egregious facts in this case and the gun had been given to James and Jennifer crumley's teenage son as a Christmas present yeah the the gun ownership how the gun was stored these were the big things that the case hinged on and these were the things that also judge Cheryl Matthews mentioned right before she read her sentence she said that Mr Crumbley had left the gun um accessible to this child and that Jennifer Crumbley had glorified the use of this weapon um we know now that the gun was purchased a few days before the shooting by the father and that the mother had taken the shooter to a shooting range to practice with it beforehand and those were facts that came up in both of their trials as not only deeply upsetting but really highlighting the negligence that uh the prosecutors were trying to illustrate how significant Kim could any precedent set by this case be this is really um at the Leading Edge of a kind of prosecutions that are relatively new uh there was a case in Lake County Illinois outside of Chicago where the father of uh the Highland Park shooter was given a misdemeanor uh or he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge but this is the most serious I mean this is definitely one that it is unprecedented and it is creating a framework uh other prosecutors around the country have said it's creating a framework for how they can potentially hold parents or Guardians accountable when their children pick up weapons and hurt somebody and briefly Kim for those in the US who want to see much tighter controls and guns do they think that this case these sentences could could make a difference that's still a little bit unclear when the shooting happened the state of Michigan actually didn't have a safe storage gun law so there was no legal requirement that the parents lock up their guns there is still an overall legal duty to store them responsibly there is a law now and it was in part because of this shooting and at Michigan State University but it's definitely giving prosecutors and lawmakers you know a reason to give a second look at existing gun laws and say you know maybe we can do something a little more to um up the expectations of of parents who have guns when they also have children in the home okay Kim bware thank you very much\"],\n [{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-09 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"European court rules human rights violated by climate

group of elderly women by failing to adequately fight climate change well the court said that Switzerland's efforts to meet its emission reduction targets had been woefully inadequate the Judgment also ruled that the women had been denied access to justice as their case had been rejected by all Swiss courts well we recently heard from the Swiss president Viola amard who said sustainability biod diversity and Net Zero are very important to Switzerland she said the country would continue to keep working on them well that came as two other cases were ruled inadmissible now in those six Portuguese Youth and a French mayor were also attempting to force their governments and others in Europe to take more ambitious action to fight climate change well in a moment we will hear from a climate change lawyer but first let's have a listen to climate activist Greta tunberg who shared her reaction to today's verdicts today's rulings make very clear that European states have a legal responsibility to take real climate action and to protect people and to protect its citizens um it cannot be a political Choice whether to respect human rights or not Greta tunberg there will Tessa CS an international climate change lawyer and the executive director of uplift it's a climate campaign group I spoke to her earlier about these cases well it's a case that was brought um on behalf of a large group of elderly Swiss women um on the basis that older women in particular are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change we've seen for example with heat waves that are driven or made more intense by climate change that when those hit it's often the elderly and elderly women in particular whose Health suffers and so they've brought this case arguing that Switzerland uh climate change policies its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions uh is inadequate to protect the health the housing the human rights of Swiss women and they've succeeded and the courts confirmed today that it is a legally binding obligation that governments have to make sure that their climate change policies are sufficient to protect people's human rights so it's a really significant finding you say it's significant Tessa but how of it is actually symbolic what would the Swiss government now have to do following this ruling well like any government that is found to be in breach of its legal obligations it's now under an obligation to align its action with what the law requires so what's clear although you know I'm yet to read the 100 Page Plus judgment in detail but in the past when courts have made these sorts of findings and they have made these sorts of findings in other countries in the past it requires governments to be more ambitious in terms of their policies to cut carbon emissions they've got to stop burning fossil fuels at the pace that they currently do so the path of action is very clear and Tessa it wasn't all good news for people filing those cases today we had some young people in Portugal and a mayor in France whose cases were ruled inadmissible once again if you could just tell us a little bit about those two cases yeah certainly so the case on behalf of Portuguese young people was brought again because there was real concern that the way that the impacts of climate change have been playing out in Portugal which is you know increasingly intense and frequent wildfires heat waves those are having really tangible impacts on the lives and on the health of young people in Portugal and so again they've argued that it's a breach of their human rights in this instance the court didn't make any finding as to whether or not um the portug government or any other European government is in fact breaching their human rights they simply made a finding that those young people should have ventilated that claim they should have gone first to court in Portugal before going to a higher Court which is the European Court of Human Rights so they didn't actually engage with the merits of that argument at all they simply said that it wasn't the right Forum in which to hear that claim and you work in this field uh of legal uh cases around climate are we likely to see more of these kind of cases coming up how widespread um is it for people around the world to bring such cases well we absolutely will see more of these kinds of cases it's already a widespread phenomenon there are literally dozens of cases that are currently playing out in countries around the world it's not just limited to the UK and Europe although there is an active case in UK Courts at the moment challenging the robustness and the credibility of the UK government's climate change policy but you know we've seen cases in Latin America in Africa in Australia in the US they are everywhere and the findings of the Court the European Court of Human Rights today will I think only underline that this is an issue that rises to the question of whether or not governments are acting lawfully and inevitably I think we will see as people get more and more desperate as they continue to see governments failing to act with the seriousness and the speed that's required they will inevitably turn to courts more and more\"],\n [{\n            'v': 22,\n            'f': \"22\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-21 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"US accuses Apple of monopolising

a decade iPhone sales have made up a majority of Apple's annual revenue today Apple's share of the US performance smartphone market exceeds 70% and its share of the entire us smartphone market exceeds 65% Apple charges as much as nearly $1600 for an iPhone but as our complaint alleges Apple has maintain Monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating Federal antitrust law consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law we allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary anti-competitive conduct that hurts both consumers and Developers for consumers that has meant fewer choices higher prices in fees lower quality smartphones apps and accessories and less Innovation from Apple and its competitors for developers that has meant being forced to play by rules that insulate Apple from competition and as outlined in our complaint we allege that Apple has Consolidated its Monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse Apple carries out its exclusionary anti-competitive conduct in two principal ways first Apple imposes contractual restrictions and fees that limit the features and functionality that developer can offer iPhone users second Apple selectively restricts access to the points of connection between third-party apps and the iPhone's operating system degrading the functionality of non-apple apps and accessories as a result for most of the past 15 years Apple has collected a tax in the form of a 30% Commission on the price of any app downloaded from the App Store as well as on inapp purchases apple is able to command these fees from companies of all sizes Apple has also suppressed the emergence of programs like Cloud streaming apps including gaming apps as well as super apps that could reduce user dependence on Apple's own operating system and expensive hardware and as any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message or received a tiny grainy video can attest Apple's anti-competitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-apple products it does this by diminishing the functionality of its own messaging app and by diminishing the functionality of third-party messaging apps by doing so Apple knowingly and deliberately degrades quality privacy and security for its users for example if an iPhone user messages a non-phone user in apple messages the text appears not only as a green bubble but incorporates limited functionality the conversation is not in red videos are pixelated and grainy and users cannot edit messages or see typing indicators as a result iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse even though apple is the one responsible for breaking crossplatform messaging and it does so intentionally for example in 2013 a senior executive at Apple explained that supporting crossplatform messaging in apple messages quote would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones close quote in 2022 Apple's CEO was asked whether Apple would fix iPhone to Android messaging the questioner added quote not to make it personal but I can't send my mom certain videos close quote Apple's CEO CEO responded buy your mom and iPhone in addition to selectively controlling app distribution and creation we allege that apple is violating the law by conditionally restricting developers access to the interface which is needed to make an app functional on the Apple operating system for a product like a smartwatch or a digital wallet to be useful to an iPhone user it must be able to communicate with the iPhone's operating system but Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem when it comes to SmartWatches Apple not only drives users to purchase an Apple Watch which is only compatible with an iPhone it also uses its Technical and contractual controls to make it harder for someone with an iPhone to use a non-apple smartwatch and when it comes to digital wallets Apple's exclusionary conduct goes a step further digital wallets allow users to store and use passes and credentials in a single app including credit cards personal identification movie tickets and car keys Apple wallet is Apple's proprietary digital wallet on the iPhone Apple actively encourages Banks merchants and other parties to participate in apple wallet but it's simultaneously exerts its Monopoly power to block these same Partners from developing alternative payment products and services for iPhone users for example Apple has blocked thirdparty developers from creating competing digital Wallets on the iPhone they use what is known as tap to pay functionality that is the function that makes a digital wallet well a wallet instead Apple forces those who want to use the wallet function to share personal information with apple even if they would prefer to share that information solely with their Bank medical provider or other trusted third party when an iPhone user puts a credit or debit card in apple wallet Apple inserts itself into the process that would otherwise occur directly between the user and the card issuer this introduces an additional potential point of failure for the privacy and security of Apple users and that is just one way in which apple is willing to make the iPhone less secure and less private in order to maintain its Monopoly power the Supreme Court defines Monopoly power as quote the power to control prices or exclude competition as set out in our complaint Apple has that power in the smartphone market now having Monopoly power does not itself violate the antitrust laws but it does when a firm acquires or maintains Monopoly power not because it has a superior product or Superior business acument but by engaging in exclusionary conduct as set out in our complaint Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority because of its unlawful exclusionary Behavior monopolies like apples threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based they stifle Innovation they hurt producers and workers and they increase costs for consumers if left unchallenged Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone Monopoly but there's a law for that the justice department will vigorously enforce and I trust law enforcing the law protects consumers from higher prices and fewer choices that is a Justice Department's legal obligation that is what the American people expect that is what they deserve\"],\n [{\n            'v': 23,\n            'f': \"23\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-25 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Boeing boss to leave as firm faces safety crisis  | BBC

1348,\n            'f': \"1348\",\n        },\n\"uh yeah first up let's start with Boeing all change the playmaker has revealed that its chief executive David Calhoun will leave by the end of this year the company also said the boss of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for reelection The Firm of course is under pressure after a door panel on a plane blew out in midair in January no one was injured during the incident but the firm's safety record has come under renewed scrutiny well let's get more on this now from John Grant who's an independent Aviation analyst good afternoon to you and firstly change at the top does often follow this sort of thing doesn't it but do you think this will address the underlying issues here regarding safety but it's John strippin by the way rather than John Grant oh apologies John my apologies I badly misinformed there but so yeah there has been these underlying issues hasn't there uh with the technical side of things safety wise yeah do you feel like this will convince people I think this marks a fundamental change and of course we're talking about a time scale the head of boing commercial airplanes leaving immediately the CEO still in post till the end of the year I'm not normally a person who would flippantly say regime change is necessary but I think this is very very symbolic and critical to Boeing's Rehabilitation to go back to position of where it was a preeminent industry manufacturing known for quality and obviously above all safety we've seen so much much going on in the last couple of years since we had the the grounding of the the max eight aircraft after two fatal crashes we've had the last few months one day after another news flow since we had the door come out of the Alaska 737 I think what this does is send a message in every respect internally to the workforce that at the top things are changing it's a break from the past outwardly both to uh Airline customers many of whom have been critical uh of the business if not directly calling for the head of the CEO and the head of commercial airplanes and of course to to the traveling public as well and and indeed Wall Street so it's going to take some months to do and I think what we need to do is look to the Future and make sure that now this this is going to happen that the right people are indeed appointed to have the right skill set the right experience to lead going forward take it out of this very unfortunate period of years it's experienced recently uh what do you think the impact might be on passengers when we see major surgery needed like this does tend to hit uh the production line for example and then that Finds Its way through the tickets well there should be no effect on on production I mean it is a technical business for our production processes of course the focus for spotlight is already on quality the lack of quality the the failures we've seen that have led to the most recent accident for example that work has to continue Dave cohon while he is still CEO has said that he'll do everything possible to ensure that it's put right the removal of executives below him now including Stan deal head of commercial airplanes recently the head of the 737 program the one which is primarily of a spotlight have happened but those processes have to continue to be one adhered to strengthened we have The Regulators not least for FAA looking with close scrutiny boeings in the midst of a 90-day period when he has to come up with an action plan to put these things right so it has to continue deliveries are still taking place to airlines that in itself is a challenge for many delays a lot of unhappy C customers including Ryan Air for example but from a customer point of view yeah maybe there could be some peripheral impact on ticket prices this summer because capacity tight we've again already heard that from Ry a and others Boeing is not alone in in having aircraft with uh technical challenges this sub capacity is tight but I think uh daytoday the industry will perform within those constraints as it otherwise would okay John listen John Strickland there Strickland thank you very much indeed for your time there for analysis on Boeing well let's uh get a bit more reaction from New York on this I think we can cross now to Michelle flurry our North America business correspondent Michelle uh early days on the stock market I guess the reaction though has been been pretty good so far uh will this be enough do you think to to convince shareholders investors I I mean I think there's a sense at least initially uh from analysts and investors that this will kind of help the share price uh in part uh they think it's a positive shake up for Boeing uh that this is a step forward in an attempt to win back trust um that being said though it is just a first step you know I wanted to read you a sort of quote we had from someone throwing a bit of skepticism um saying look uh there could be some cultural change happening at boing we've long thought that the issues at Boeing have been seated in cultural challenges that was Cameron Dawson um who is Chief investment officer at New Age wealth I think a lot will depend on who Calhoun's successor ultimately is and how far the company is able to show that it is changing the culture from the top um and so that really is sort of going to be the kind of the test here but obviously the company felt it had to do something it was under increasing pressure not just from the financial sector but you also saw from government officials and indeed from its customers and I think that's why you've got Dave for example saying he is going to step down falling on his sword and trying to kind of address some of the criticism that has been leveled at this company yeah I I mean normally with this we do get sort of big changes as I was just chatting there with John um I mean do you sort of feel like the trick is they have to show they taking some serious action but kind of keep business carrying on as normal as best as possible not too much Tom I'll just try and steady things well look I mean I think you know what makes Boeing different from certainly other companies is is that you're talking about essentially two main players in this market Boeing is the American sort of major player here uh the European other player is Airbus essentially we're talking about a duopoly when there are only two players I think ultimately uh the customers in this case the airlines don't really have much alternative in terms of where they can turn to to try and buy their aircraft they're already facing these long delays waiting for deliveries of planes I mean who else are they going to go to where are they going to go air bus is already sort of uh pretty much at full capacity and so I think Boeing has room to get it right but what we're seeing here is the pressure on the company to say you need to go further and I think this is the attempt by management and the speed with which you're seeing the head of the commercial uh side of the company leaving immediately not waiting uh I think they're trying to send a message we are trying to write the ship but right now A once Great American company uh is certainly struggling\"],\n [{\n            'v': 24,\n            'f': \"24\",\n

was the hottest March ever recorded new figures from the eu's cernus climate service extend the world's run of record-breaking air temperatures to 10 consecutive months the average was 0.1 Celsius above the previous High set in 2016 a significant margin by global standards our climate editor Justin rout reports last week the president of Zimbabwe declared a national disaster because of a deep drought in the country low rainfall has slashed crop yields driving up food prices and putting an estimated 2.7 million people at risk of hunger it is just one example of a pattern of heat and drought affecting countries as far a field as southern Europe and Southeast Asia this graph shows how march continued the world's run of record-breaking monthly temperatures this extreme heat has got many climate scientists worried the reality is that we can quantify a large proportion of the the extra heat that's causing these records but not all of it so there needs to be a lot more science and there will be much more science coming out over the next weeks and months to try and understand what's happening to our climate system and are we in a new phase scientists agree what is causing climate change it is the vast quantities of Planet warming gases Humanity has been pumping into the atmosphere and in recent months a recurring weather event known as El Nino has been adding an extra blast of heat into the air that is weakening now so temperatures should begin to fall back later in the year the problem is sea temperatures remain extremely high hitting many of the world's coral reefs hard that suggests global temperatures might not fall back as expected a sign fear some scientists that the world could be entering a new phase of more rapid climate change Justin rollat BBC News let's get some analysis now with Dr Khloe brimham climate scientist and heat wav researcher at the University of Gratz in Austria welcome to you thanks very much for being with us um what are your thoughts your analysis on this latest report and these figures so I think that it's now not a surprise to see these temperature records being broken month on month and as uh Justin roll out was saying um we know that this is to do with um elino also adding heat into the system and so we're seeing these temperatures consecutively broken but also the extreme weather events like that in Zimbabwe that we're seeing and elsewhere in the world and what consequences do you think we're likely to see in the coming months so we're coming into the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and that's where most people live and and so we know that we're going to likely to see an increase in the number of heat waves I can't sell you exactly right now because it's too far in advance but we are likely to see heat waves increase in sort of drought conditions but also increases in things like flash flooding and wildfires basically the same as what we've seen um in past summers in recent years and so it is quite concerning that we might be entering a new climate phase yeah and we have seen a record-breaking temperatures both on land and in the sea over the past several months haven't we uh we constantly hear about a a Tipping Point where climate change accelerates and becomes Unstoppable are you fearful that we've reached that point I think that we all need to be hopeful so tipping points a two side of a coin and so we have positive social tipping points so if we all come together like we did on covid we can um basically Al it's never too early to start um slowing the tide on climate change and making things better for basically all of us we've also seen reports in the news recently of um the price of chocolate Rising because of climate change and so I think we keep seeing these reports and it's affecting Europe also growingly and we just need to act on it and we know what we need to do we know we need a transition to Net Zero we know we need to put in place support for count in the global sou for the worst impacts of climate change and so now is the time to start acting and and hopefully by month 11 of record-breaking uh temperatures we will hopefully start to see that yeah you say now is a time to start acting I mean sadly we've heard that for many years haven't we the UN holds a climate conference every year cop where countries commit to various things with regards to emissions targets do you feel that you know the world world leaders have come to grips with this they are dealing with this and if not why not what is stopping us I don't think that world leaders have come to grips with this I think there are probably standout Nations that are doing more than others um I think that it's very difficult because at cop you're trying to call for Global consensus and it's very difficult to get everybody to agree on one thing the standout environmental standard that does that is the Montreal protocol which um you know stops cfc's um and started closing the ozone hole and so if we can get the same sort of commitment um from countries and the same sort of progress we could have that same turnaround for climate change it's just getting the commitment there and putting sort of um National fiveyear agendas behind us and thinking of long-term goals and I think that's what been the challenge but also the communication and just how urgent this actually is and the realization that this is affecting societies right now and we need to act on this right now not in a 100 years Time Dr Chloe brim I'm really interesting to get your thoughts and Analysis thank you

Trump said he was responsible for the 2022 Supreme Court decision ending a federal right to the procedure adding that in his view abortion was now where everybody wanted it to be from a legal standpoint he didn't specify a gestational week at which he would ban abortion but he said he supported exceptions for rape incest and to protect the life of the mother many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended row v Wade they wanted it ended it must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even even beyond the 9th month the concept of having an abortion in the later months and even execution after birth and that's exactly what it is the baby is born the baby is executed after birth is unacceptable and almost everyone agrees with that my view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint the states will determine by Vote or legislation or perhaps both and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the state many states will be different many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others and that's what they will be at the end of the day this is all about the will of the people you must follow your heart or in many cases your religion or your faith do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself do what's right for your children do what's right right for our country and vote so important to vote at the end of the day it's all about will of the people that's where we are right now and that's what we want the will of the people well Michael Sherer National political reporter with the Washington Post gave me his reaction well he's definitely been leaning in that direction for a number of months there were a couple Kur fuff during the primary in which he said similar things about not wanting a federal Banner as campaign did about uh Republican voters needing to respect the will of the people and then he would back off of that because he was in a Republican primary this is really a political move he's got an enormous headwind and actually you know Republicans running Statewide for Senate have enormous headwind abortion has really motivated Democratic voters and he's trying to uh dampen down that issue he knows it's something that uh you know really threatens to defeat him in November and he's trying to take away the idea that as president he would push for a federal ban even though during his term as president president he did push for a 20we ban uh and and members of his party are going to continue to push for a ban and he's previously said he would work something out um this won't change what the Biden campaign's doing they're going to spend you know2 200 300 million dos on Advertising you know saying that the reason in a lot of these key swing States you no longer have the same access to abortion is uh is President Trump and row and probably surfacing some of his old comments in which he did call for basically a ban on abortion I mean at one point and he took this back he even called for um prosecution of of women who had abortions um so this doesn't take the issue off the table but he's hoping it will reduce the severity of it for himself and I know it is very early because this statement has only just come out but is it likely to you know reduce opposition from potential supporters so I I think it's a complicated question I don't think we know the answer uh you know the the there is going to be some backlash from the right from his conservative Evangelical supporters who have long supported Federal uh legislation restricting abortion he's basically ruling that out here he has previously supported Federal legislation now whether those people stay home or vote third party is is you know an open question they probably don't um I don't think this has you know it like it's a matter of degree it doesn't change completely the conversation if you look at a lot of the state stes where this presidential election is going to be decided Georgia North Carolina Michigan Wisconsin Arizona abortion is very much a live issue on the state level the only reason it's a live issue on the state level is uh that roie Wade was overturned and and president Trump is claiming credit for overturning roie Wade so it doesn't take him out of the conversation about abortion and I think uh Biden will be able to go to voters and say look the reason you're concerned that you or your daughter or your wife are going to have trouble getting abortion access uh right now is is that President Trump did this and and President Biden is running on a platform of restoring roie Wade uh on the federal level\"],\n [{\n            'v': 27,\n

minority ringas have been conscripted to fight for myanmar's embattled military Jun the BBC has learned that is despite the fact that ringas are denied citizenship and are subjected to a range of discriminatory restrictions including a ban on travel outside their communities well our southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan headed is in Bangkok and told me more about what he's learned well with my burmes colleagues we've spoken to um seven different people in Five camps now you have to remember that while uh millions of ringers have left rakine State 700,000 were driven out in the Dreadful attacks on them by the military back in 2017 an operation described by the UN as possible genocide another 600,000 R remain in reine state in this very precarious situation and a quarter of those are confined to these squalled um IDP camps um they've been there since communal violence 12 years ago they can't move and we spoke to these seven people in five different camps just to confirm that this systematic constriction was going on the military government has denied it they say they're just getting ringers prepared to defend their own camps this is not what we heard we heard that the military been going around and telling the camp organizers that they must provide lists of young men ready to be conscripted uh between 15 and 25 from each Camp each time they came and these men were then selected they were told they had no choice that their families would be threatened by the military if they didn't comply they was sent for training taught out of fire guns and then thrown into battle and in rakine state where the ringas are there is a huge amount of conflict at the moment between an Insurgent Army the arican Army and the military the military has been pushed back it's been defeated there as it has been in many other parts of Myanmar and it's struggling to fill its ranks it's lost a lot of troops through desertion or through injuries and so it's simply using the ringas instead and they described horrific experiences of being thrown into these brutal battle chaotic battles uh where they suffered injuries they saw other reinges killed eventually they were sent back um to home after after the battle was over but they're sitting some of them have gone into hiding because they say that we're being told we might be summoned to go back and fight again and presumably Jonathan they they have no hope of that situation changing well they're trapped you see we we we know of lots of people in Myanmar after this conscription law was enforced in the last few weeks because the military can't get people to join the Army it's so unpopular lots of people in myama are fleeing they're either coming here to Thailand or they're going underground but these reinges are stuck in these camps they're never allowed to move anyway they're completely trapped and they're very easy for the military to go and just point a finger and say you've got to join but think of the Hideous irony here the military in particular uh does not recognize the reinges as having any legal right to live in Myanmar they've pursued these Dreadful policies against some of discrimination and outright um killings in back in 2017 they've always been regarded Ed almost as sort of UNP as people who just don't belong and yet now they're being forced to fight the military's battles and it has another bad knock on consequence because the local rakine Buddhist population the other community in rakine supports the insurgence and it's only going to inflame tensions between them and the reinges when the reinges are seen unwillingly of course fighting on the military side so it's going to store up a lot of problems to the Future it's Jonathan head in Bangkok\"],\n [{\n            'v': 28,\n

people have been rescued after floods in Northern Sydney other residents have been told to be prepared to flee their homes because of the rising flood waters the area's main reservoir which supplies most of the city's drinking water has started to overflow you can see that there there's been 3 days of torrential rainfall across eastern Australia people living in parts of New South Wales have been told to stay indoors it's important to note that flood levels in some of the rivers particularly in Western Sydney are continuing to rise and that presents a real danger for some communities so it's very important for those who live in communities that are lowly flood prone areas that you continue to listen to emergency broadcasts from the sces well let's speak to our Sydney correspondent Phil merer Phil uh what where do things stand right now well at the moment we know that there are two deaths that have been associated with these wild days of weather here in eastern Australia on Thursday a 71-year-old man was found in floodwaters near Brisbane in the state of Queensland and earlier today a man's body was found in flood waters in western parts of Sydney now the now the police here say that they don't know the circumstances of the second fatality but safe to say it has been a wild old few days in eastern Australia record-breaking amounts of rain have fallen here in the state of New South Wales across one 24-hour period A month's worth of rain fell so at the moment there have still there are still evacuation orders in place in parts of Sydney but um thankfully for the 5 million or so residents of this city this storm system is moving south and it is expected to head out to see over the weekend but as you'd imagine the flood warnings are continuing because all of that rain is flowing into rivers and creeks their levels are rising so with them uh the risk of flooding to low-lying areas and briefly was there any way to prepare to avoid some of the issues you just talked about some of the the dangers that people are facing Australia is a land well used to Nature's extremes the authorities are very good at giving Advanced warnings to motorists to homeowners and commuters but still people find themselves facing Peril as you mentioned dozens of people have had to be rescued by emergency services so it is uh a mercy in a way that although two people have died tragic of course for those family members left behind but it is an indication that Australia is pretty good at giving warnings to its citizens when when these extreme events um Rumble through communities in this country all right thank you so much for that update\"],\n [{\n            'v': 29,\n            'f': \"29\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-05 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Emergency

week's earthquake many are trapped in Highway tunnels or cut off in remote areas after the earthquake on Wednesday at least 10 people were killed in the Island's biggest quake in more than a quarter of a century but authorities say more bodies are expected to be recovered our correspondent rapet Winfield Hayes sent us this report from the capital taipe well it seems the situation has improved quite a lot today with those people who are trapped up in a Gorge about 15 km or about 10 mil to the west of here uh that that is a very deep gorge there are many landslides that have blocked the roads in there but rescue teams have managed to get in to where the people are stranded there's about 640 people trapped up there in a village where there is a hotel and there are other buildings so they are being sheltered there we understand around 400 of them are Sheltering in the hotel and the others in other uh buildings there so that they are safe they're not in immediate danger they are now getting supplies in there by helicopter but it is very difficult to get them out because the road is blocked by landslides you can only get in and out by foot they are bringing them out in small groups we saw about 40 people brought out today including people with young children and elderly people a group of elderly tourists from America were brought out but it is going to take just quite a long time to get so many people down that road in small groups especially as we've had a lot of aftershocks here today and every time there's an Aftershock that operation has to stop because it's bringing more rock uh uh coming tumbling down the mountain sides and very briefly rert looking at those efforts behind you um what's the situation like with with trying to stabilize buildings which have been affected by the Quake yeah well this is one of the buildings that was partially brought down by the Quake on Wednesday morning it's leaning over at a very precarious angle they have been putting rein reinforcing it but the plan now tonight is to start tearing that building down and the reason they want to bring it down is because it represents a real threat every time there's an Aftershock so they want to bring it down in a controlled way three pit Windfield Hayes in taipe speaking earlier to my colleague Anita mcy\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\",

            "hello I'm Nikki schill welcome to the program we start this hour with the latest developments in the Middle East President Biden has promised Israel Ironclad United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you\n"
