The majority of liver cancer arises in the context of chronic inflammation and cirrhosis. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have been the guideline-recommended treatment options for decades. Despite enormous advances in the field of liver cancer therapy, an effective cure is yet to be found. Plant-derived polyphenols constitute a large family of phytochemicals, with pleiotropic effects and little toxicity. They can drive cellular events and modify multiple signaling pathways which involves initiation, progression and metastasis of liver cancer and play an important role in contributing to anti-liver cancer drug development. The potential of plant-derived polyphenols for treating liver cancer has gained attention from research clinicians and pharmaceutical scientists worldwide in the last decades. This review overviews hepatic carcinogenesis and briefly discusses anti-liver cancer mechanisms associated with plant-derived polyphenols, specifically involving cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and metastasis. We focus on plant-derived polyphenols with experiment-based chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties against liver cancer and generalize their basic molecular mechanisms of action. We also discuss potential opportunities and challenges in translating plant-derived polyphenols from preclinical success into clinical applications.', metadata={'uid': '38625672', 'Title': 'Liver cancer wars: plant-derived polyphenols strike back.', 'Published': '2024-04-16', 'Copyright Information': '© 2024.

Here, we evaluated the influence of liver fibrosis and inflammation on quantitative M2BPGi (M2BPGi-Qt) in CLD, considering each etiology.\\nMETHODS: We recruited 1373 patients with CLD. To evaluate the influence of liver fibrosis and inflammation on M2BPGi-Qt levels, we assessed M2BPGi-Qt levels at each fibrosis and activity stage within different etiologies of CLD based on pathological findings. Subsequently, we evaluated if the accuracy of fibrosis staging based on M2BPGi-Qt could be improved by considering the influence of liver inflammation.\\nRESULTS: In patients with viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and primary biliary cholangitis, the median M2BPGi-Qt levels increased liver fibrosis progression. Median M2BPGi-Qt levels were not associated with the degree of fibrosis in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Median M2BPGi-Qt levels increased with the progression of liver activity in all etiologies. A significant difference was found at each stage in AIH. Considering the liver inflammation, we established an algorithm, M2BPGi-Qt, to determine the alanine aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (MAP-R) in liver cirrhosis (LC). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of MAP-R was higher than that of the M2BPGi-Qt for detecting LC (AUC MAP-R\\u2009=\\u20090.759 and M2BPGi-Qt\\u2009=\\u20090.700, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).\\nCONCLUSIONS: The quantitative measurement system for M2BPGi depends on liver fibrosis and inflammation, regardless of etiology.

              " Document(page_content='The brain is the central commander of all physical activities and the expression of emotions in animals. Its development and cognitive health critically depend on the neural network that consists of neurons, glial cells (namely, non-neuronal cells), and neurotransmitters (communicators between neurons). The latter include proteinogenic amino acids (e.g., L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and glycine) and their metabolites [e.g., γ-aminobutyrate, D-aspartate, D-serine, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin)]. In addition, some non-neurotransmitter metabolites of amino acids, such as taurine, creatine, and carnosine, also play important roles in brain development, cognitive health, behavior, and mood of dogs and cats. Much evidence shows that cats require dietary ω3 (α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) and ω6 (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) polyunsaturated fatty acids for the development of the central nervous system. As an essential component of membranes of neurons and glial cells, cholesterol is also crucial for cognitive development and function. In addition, vitamins and minerals are required for the metabolism of AAs, lipids, and glucose in the nervous system, and also act as antioxidants. Thus, inadequate nutrition will lead to mood disorders. Some amino acids (e.g., arginine, glycine, methionine, serine, taurine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) can help to alleviate behavioral and mood disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety and aggression). As abundant providers of all these functional amino acids and lipids, animal-sourced foods (e.g., liver, intestinal mucosa, and meat) play important roles in brain development, cognitive function, and mood of dogs and cats. This may explain, in part, why dogs and cats prefer to eat visceral organs of their prey. Adequate provision of nutrients in all phases of the life cycle (pregnancy, lactation, postnatal growth, and adulthood) is essential for optimizing neurological health, while preventing cognitive dysfunction and abnormal behavior.', metadata={'uid': '38625529', 'Title': 'Roles of Nutrients in the Brain Development, Cognitive Function, and Mood of Dogs and Cats.', 'Published': '--', 'Copyright Information': '© 2024.

These carnivores have a relatively shorter digestive tract but longer canine teeth, a tighter digitation of molars, and a greater stomach volume than omnivorous\\xa0mammals such as humans and pigs. Both dogs and cats have no detectable or a very low activity of salivary α-amylase but dogs, unlike cats, possess a relatively\\xa0high\\xa0activity of pancreatic α-amylase. Thus, cats select low-starch foods but dogs can consume high-starch diets. In contrast to\\xa0many mammals, the vitamin B (cobalamin)-binding intrinsic factor for the digestion and absorption of vitamin B is produced in: (a) dogs primarily by pancreatic ductal cells and to a lesser extent the gastric mucosa; and (b) cats exclusively by the pancreatic tissue. Amino acids (glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate) are the main metabolic fuels in enterocytes of the foregut. The primary function of the small intestine is to digest and absorb dietary nutrients, and its secondary function is to regulate the entry of dietary nutrients into the blood circulation, separate the external from the internal milieu, and perform immune surveillance. The major function of the large intestine is to ferment undigested food (particularly fiber and protein) and to absorb water, short-chain fatty acids (serving as major metabolic fuels for epithelial cells of the large intestine), as well as vitamins. The fermentation products, water, sloughed cells, digestive secretions, and microbes form feces and then pass into the rectum for excretion via the anal canal. The microflora influences colonic absorption and cell metabolism, as well as feces quality.

This study aimed to systemically evaluate eleven PMB PopPK models from ten published literature based on a new independent population, which was divided into four different populations, patients with liver dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, liver and kidney dysfunction, and normal liver and kidney function. The whole data set consisted of 146 patients with 391 PMB concentrations. The prediction- and simulation-based diagnostics and Bayesian forecasting were conducted to evaluate model predictability. In the overall evaluation process, none of the models exhibited satisfactory predictive ability in both prediction- and simulation-based diagnostic simultaneously. However, the evaluation of the models in the subgroup of patients with normal liver and kidney function revealed improved predictive performance compared to those with liver and/or kidney dysfunction. Bayesian forecasting demonstrated enhanced predictability with the incorporation of two to three prior observations. The external evaluation highlighted a lack of consistency between the prediction results of published models and the external validation dataset.

These effects are often observed in the long term but are not well documented after short periods of fasting. Fasting for a few days is a common practice in fish farming, especially before handling the fish, such as for short sorting, tank transfers, and vaccinations. In the present study, rainbow trout were subjected to a 4-day fast and then refed, for 8\\xa0days, a conventional diet containing fishmeal (control diet) or alternative diets composed of terrestrial animal by-products supplemented or not with a yeast extract. During the refeeding period alone, most of the parameters considered did not differ significantly in response to the different feeds. Only the expression of claudin-15 was upregulated in fish fed the yeast-supplemented diet compared to the control diet. Conversely, fasting followed by refeeding significantly influenced most of the parameters analyzed. In the proximal intestine, the surface area of villi significantly increased, and the density of goblet cell tended to decrease during refeeding. Although no distinct plasma immune response or major signs of gut inflammation were observed, some genes involved in the structure, complement pathway, antiviral functions, coagulation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress response of the liver and intestine were significantly regulated by refeeding after fasting. These results indicate that short-term fasting, as commonly practiced in fish farming, significantly alters the physiology of the liver and intestine regardless of the composition of the diet.', metadata={'uid': '38625479', 'Title': 'Gut physiology of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is influenced more by short-term fasting followed by refeeding than by feeding fishmeal-free diets.', 'Published': '2024-04-16', 'Copyright Information': '© 2024.

Healthy individuals (n=24) and patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, n=18) were included as controls.

We measured the concentrations of glucose, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, the two incretin hormones glucose insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We calculated the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole body insulin resistance (Matsuda index), insulin clearance, and insulinogenic index. All patient groups had increased fasting plasma glucose and impaired glucose responses compared with healthy controls. Beta-cell secretion was increased in AIH, PBC, and MASLD but not in PSC. AIH and MASLD patients had hyperglucagonemia and hepatic, as well as peripheral, insulin resistance and decreased insulin clearance, resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Patients with autoimmune liver disease had an increased GIP response, and those with AIH or PBC had an increased GLP-1 response. Our data demonstrate that the mechanism underlying glucose disturbances in patients with autoimmune liver disease differs from that underlying MASLD, including compensatory incretin responses in patients with autoimmune liver disease.

CD4+ T cells are pathogenic in RRMS, and defective T cell function could be mediated in part by liver X receptors (LXRs) - nuclear receptors that regulate lipid homeostasis and immunity. RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis identified that genes within the 'lipid metabolism' and 'signalling of nuclear receptors' pathways were dysregulated in CD4+ T cells isolated from RRMS patients compared with healthy donors. While LXRB and genes associated with cholesterol metabolism were upregulated, other T cell LXR-target genes, including genes involved in cellular lipid uptake (inducible degrader of the LDL receptor, IDOL), and the rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (UDP-glucosylceramide synthase, UGCG) were downregulated in T cells from patients with RRMS compared to healthy donors. Correspondingly, plasma membrane glycosphingolipids were reduced, and cholesterol levels increased in RRMS CD4+ T cells, an effect partially recapitulated in healthy T cells by in vitro culture with T cell receptor stimulation in the presence of serum from RRMS patients. Notably, stimulation with LXR-agonist GW3965 normalised membrane cholesterol levels, and reduced proliferation and IL17 cytokine production in RRMS CD4+ T-cells. Thus, LXR-mediated lipid metabolism pathways were dysregulated in T cells from patients with RRMS and could contribute to RRMS pathogenesis.
