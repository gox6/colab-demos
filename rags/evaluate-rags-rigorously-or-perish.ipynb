              " Document(page_content=\"and we begin with events in the Middle East where Israel appears to be trying to gather international support following the Iranian air strikes but has not so far at least carried out any direct military action in response instead Israel is calling for more sanctions on Iran which itself has warned Israel against attempting any retaliation following those drone and missile attacks which Iran says were a response to an Israeli attack on its diplomatic mission in Syria Chief International correspondent Lee duet has been sending us updates from Jerusalem Israel says it is now launching a diplomatic offensive the Israeli foreign minister has written he says to 32 countries around the world urging them to impose even more sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran the foreign minister Israel Katz posted this on X formerly Twitter saying Israel that Iran has to be stopped now for it is too late and that is the message that's also being sounded by Leading senior military officials here in Israel including the chief of staff leftenant General hery halvi he said that Israel would have to respond he made the comments by visiting the Neva team Airbase in southern Israel where some of Iran's missiles did actually hit in the early hours of Sunday morning although Israel says there was limited damage Israel says only a handful of missiles actually got through of the 350 suicide drones and Cru and ballistic missiles which were fired by Iran Iran says its retaliatory strike was in response to Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital Damascus on April the 1st Iran's foreign minister Amir abdan has reiterated that message in a telephone conversation with the un Secretary General Antonio gues saying that Iran acted in legitimate self-defense Iran too is calling for restraint saying it doesn't want this to escalate into a wider War we're going to look at the Peril in this moment but just to remind you that this tension takes place in the midst of the ongoing Israel Gaza War it's the 193rd day of war and today there are reports fighting in the Gaza Strip and most particularly in bet hanon in the Northeast there are also reports that more Aid is now getting into Gaza from the north we're getting reports on the ground and that is what Israel is saying that news is being greeted with relief for many many weeks now a agencies have been warning that more than half of the population of Gaza is facing acute hunger well let's now cross to the Qatari Capital Doha to join Miranda kamrava who is the director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for research and policy studies welcome to BBC news thank you leas good to be here of course you are following every uh Twist and Turn of this escalating crisis between Israel and Iran how would you describe this particular moment well the Israelis crossed the red line by attacking Iran's diplomatic compound in Damascus and then the Iranians crossed uh another red line uh by attacking Israeli soil and so we're at a very uh precarious in fact dangerous moment where we're likely to see an Israeli retaliatory strike for Iran's retaliatory strike and so the Vicious Cycle is likely to continue unfortunately this moment seems to underline the the dangerous differences in perception Iran is saying this was a very limited a very calibrated a strike it caused limited casual limited damage for Israel of course it was a reckless strike which breached its security and must there must be a retaliation and that is what is going to fuel this conflict is it not absolutely and in fact uh I think uh we do see that the Iranians did hold back they had to somehow retaliate for the attack on their uh Embassy compound and so as far as they're concerned deterrence has been reestablished and now they're saying that if Israel attacks Iran again or Iranian interests or Personnel uh there will be more of this kind kind of retaliatory strike of course netanyahu's political predicament inside Israel don't allow for restraint and we've seen Netanyahu have a penchant for overreaction he's also under pressure from the right flank of his own cabinet and so unfortunately as you mentioned we're at a precarious and very dangerous moment indeed and the speculation now seems to be that even though there are disagreements within the War cabinet and we are hearing that the cabinet may meet again today some of the former U military generals saying we should we should we should retaliate now others saying let's build our International and our regional Coalition first because they are emphasizing that this Coalition the support Israel is receiving at this moment that matters too absolutely and uh also crucial is the support that the United States will give to is Israel both diplomatically and uh militarily and we've uh heard very loud and clear messages coming out of Washington that is that the United States would not assist Israel on an attack uh uh on Iranian soil and so I think that's also given some pause to Israeli military commanders do they really want to go it alone uh knowing that Iran has this so-called axis of resistance that it can activate when it feels very threatened Marin comad thank you very much it's always good to hear your perspective no doubt we'll hear from you again as this crisis continues to unfold and as I mentioned uh during that uh discussion that we are hearing reports that the war cabinet will meet again today this will be its third meeting since uh that unprecedented attack in the early hours of Sunday morning what is absolutely clear is that uh Israel has decided it will respond but will it retaliate by attacking Iran directly that would also be unprecedented after Decades of a shadow war and covert operations will it attack some of U Iran's proxies and Lebanon Iraq Syria uh or even indeed in Yemen or will they wait and build a coalition these these are questions which matter and they matter to the Future stability at this region in the midst of what is already a very very volatile time as our world affairs correspondent at least you set there with the latest lines uh from the

in the next 5 minutes or so statues in the ancient times we'll be seeing these coroy later on waiting for us the temple we have the priestesses featuring The high priestess as well the artistic director of The Flame lighting ceremon and the choreographer emis ignu who will in a few moments time formally there she is when she strike the drum that will formally begin the torch lighting ceremony the distinguished guests LED of course by the uh [Music] this is always a very magical moment the official Olympic flame lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia of course the uh flame was lit throughout the duration of the games and that is the continuity that we're seeing in the modern era as well once this flame is lit it will not be extinguished until the closing ceremony so that the scene live in Olympia where the sacred flame for the Paris 2024 Olympics is to be lit in of course the ancient birthplace of the games there will then be the torch relay which will spread from the Acropolis to the South Pacific and as you can see hundreds of dignitaries and Spectators are there in Southwest Greece where the modern day Olympics were born in where the ceremony is held every two years for both the summer and the Winter Olympics now you can see there uh there is the Greek actress Mary Mina now she is we think going to help bring the Olympic flame to life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror beforehand it to the first torch Bearer so there is a parabolic mirror that you can see there in the middle of your shot um which we think is actually what is going to be H used to help light the flame it will then be passed to the first torch Bearer who is a Olympic rowing Champion um and then it will be handed on as it goes on the torch relay now the ceremony here in Olympia been conducted in the ruins of the 2,600 year old Temple of Hera uh as we saw in the pictures the Greek president is there as is the international Olympic Committee president Thomas back who we heard uh talking a little earlier the torch itself harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the games the tradition was revived in 19 36 for the Berlin games now uh there will be an 11 day relay of the torch on Greek soil some 600 torch bearers will carry the flame over a distance of 5,000 kilm through 41 different municipalities and areas of Greece before it is then given over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will happen um in uh April um in the late 26th is when the actual flame gets handed over to Paris so what we're seeing at the moment is this ceremony um where we expect that uh the polished parabolic mirror will be used that you can see there in the shot to help light the flame let's have a listen in for for so if you have just joined us on BBC News news we are watching live from Olympia in Greece the sacred flame lighting ceremony for the Paris 2024 Olympics it of course happens in Olympia which is the birthplace of the ancient games before that uh torch relay takes place from the Acropolis to the South Pacific there you can see the flame being walked in to the ancient 2000 600-year-old Temple of Hera uh in Greece the Greek president the international Olympic Committee president amongst the dignitaries there as of course are the officials from the Paris 2024 Games the actual Olympics will start on the 26th of July in Paris 19 days of competition but of course before that gets underway there is always the torch relay and and it starts from Greece uh where that flame will make its move during an 11 day relay in Greece itself around 600 torch bearers will carry that flame over 5,000 km through 41 municipalities before it is then handed over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will have a special ceremony as well at the site of the first modern Olympics of 1896 uh that will happen on April the 26th then of course the across France there's going to be 10,000 torch bearers that will carry the fame across 64 different French territories uh there'll be 400 towns dozens of attractions during its 12,000 km Journey both through Mainland France and also uh the overseas French territories in the Caribbean Indian Ocean and Pacific so there we see the flame being put down um ready for the ceremony for the torch to be lit in ancient Olympia for Vil [Music] [Music] the harini so for so that is Greek actress Mary Mina who is the high priestess who is now holding that Olympic torch as she moves down to light from the flame the first torch of the [Applause] relay so there we have the Olympic flame has been lit in Olympia in Greece ahead of the Paris Summer Olympics as I say the Greek actress Mary Mina now holding that Olympic flame she is the high Priestess in this ceremony and now lighting it another flame that will burn there of course there are always backup Flames whenever the torch relay happens just in case the torch does go out there is always a backup flame that it can be relit from so that once that flame is lit it will continue throughout the journey that it will take first traveling through Greece before crossing the Mediterranean to France that's going to happen in May on a three masted ship it will then travel through France and its overseas territories before arriving in Paris for the start of the games in July that ceremony is continuing in Olympia and you can continue to watch that on our BBC

              " Document(page_content=\"you're watching the context it's time for our weekly segment AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth at some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence so we're going to start with futurism which reports that uh the humans behind the accounts of virtual influences or AI generated characters that masquerade is the real thing on social media media are now pasting fake faces onto the bodies of Real Models meanwhile Business Insider asks whether AI will put an end to gen Z's obsession with becoming an influencer after Major Brands begin to show interest in using AI models instead of humans Mashable says a misc captioned video falsely claiming to be an Iranian missile strike on Tel Aviv was promoted as legitimate by social media platform X fake headline quote Iran strikes Tel Aviv with heavy missiles was apparently generated by X's own official AI chatbot The Verge looks at Ai and copyright in the US a new bill could force uh tech companies to disclose any copyrighted materials they use to train their AI models the bill from representative uh Adam shift would require anyone making a training data set for AI to to submit reports on its contents to the copyrights register there's been a pet hate of teachers everywhere but not in Texas where they plan to replace thousands of human exam markers with artificial intelligence it's believed the AI graded tests could save $20 million a year that's from Tech spot and finally popular science uh future AI developer Google deepmind who are now able to train tiny off-the-shelf robots to play soccer uh we'll show you a bit of that later with me is priia Lani who's CEO of century Tech and artificial intelligence education technology company that develops AI powered learning tools thanks very much for coming on the program good to see you great to see you okay we're going to start now with this AI influences so artificial influence we we can take a look at um a little bit of what we are talking about so those AI influen are deep faking fake faces onto real women's bodies without permission and the the subheading there is it's a real problem is that is that how you see it yeah absolutely so the first story is about these people that are taking the real bodies of women mostly and then they're putting on a deep fake face right and then they're posting that and earning money actually from it most of the time on competitive of only fans which is a platform where essentially creators can put on their own content now in the context of only fans um more creators on only fans are women rather than men um 85% of the top 10% of earners are women and an average Creator Le just to give you a bit of context right earns about $180 a month so this is a business for some of these creators where they're you know using their own images their own bodies and creating that content and so essentially their content and their videos are being ripped off right because then you superimpose an AI face and post it elsewhere and you make money off that content so firstly you're violating personal rights yes but the second thing you're doing is obviously infringing on the the woman the creators intellectual property um and 300 people I think 300 odd odd creators have surpassed a million dollars annually earning money from from doing this so they have a very good right to be very very upset about this so it is a real problem and just just so you you get it personally this took me six 60 seconds to do actually if we can put it up on on the screen so I created one of you but actually so because there are so many tools that allow us to do this so This literally took me less than a minute actually I've done the reverse here I've got your face but I've actually changed your body yeah right you look great casual Lewis but but and so that's a bit of fern but can we have a look at it in this context so I just created this before I got here so I didn't have time to send it to the producers but if you look at my iPad leis so I took a video of you okay on BC just lift Okay so we've got you on the BBC presenting okay um a story about Tik Tok so hopefully the viewers can see that I apologize this is really last minute yeah and then uh through magic hour AI I've mashed your face with Christians Christian phrases oh my that is a terrifying thought in every way right but you see how this is you in your day job right so I've got your body I've got your I've got the BBC thankfully it stopped it stopped right so you and Christian together that's what you guys would look like um but what's interesting about that I think your your floor manager is laughing no one can hear that right now um the reason that's really important to show is that that is you in your day job and so creators are obviously creating this content you know which we we've shown um viewers and they're earning money from it so not only is it a personal affront but it's also a professional affront well and how do you you just knock knocked that up pretty quickly and pretty disturbing that's in the cab on the way here and and so how do you how do you begin to try and stop that how if it's so easy how do you how can you try and stop well and I think some of the some of the stories that we're going to come on to will help with this but obviously the input here is a an infringement right it's an infringement of Ip rights so there are laws um to protect uh copyright and we're going to talk about that in a minute in a future story but what's really important is when we're talking about this sort of generative AI okay separate it into two areas separate it into the input this is really important for the rest of how regulation and law develops in this area separate AI into the training data what was the input what data was used to train the artificial intelligence models yes and then the output what came out of the other side right now actually in the cases in the story The reason why it's just so blatant is because the output is also substantially similar right to the input okay so how do you do that well there are laws to protect in these areas is but what I find and find really really difficult is the fact that law is sometimes so expensive and difficult to access for some people so it's not actually as as Fair as saying well you know you've got recourse okay let's look at this is very very linked as you were talking Business Insider Jen's fading dream human influences are being replaced by artificial intelligence and maybe that's a good thing yeah well so so apparently a lot of gen Zed and I got anywhere from half of genz to a quarter of gened that's a lot of gen Zed want to be influencers that's the future career aspiration of of of these young people about 25% of marketers work with influencers and and again it's a job for them right so when it comes to influencers they earn a lot of money um they they create content they partner with brands for example and Brands find this really great because the return on investment from an influencer promoting your content is higher on average than if you just advertise your content so a brand would earn an average of about just over $5 in Media value for every $1 spent on an influencer so it's a huge Market but the reason why this article is basically saying your hopes and dreams no longer going to be alive right genz said is because people are using AI influencers these are completely fictitious which is what we're seeing right now so this woman here is not a real woman that's AI on top no that's AI absolutely that's yeah exactly so they're using AI to actually you know and and why right because it's cheaper right so if I can do that in a few minutes right if you're doing it where you're not substantially copying this is a different story right this is not about copying on on real pp's bodies but if you can create truly original con original output content I should say otherwise every Tech is going to have a goat me saying hang on what was the input okay but you can do that cheaper Brands can do that cheaper you don't have to pay people money you could run many characters on platforms yourself you don't have to deal with any egos that would be pretty cool right the video to me the presenter ego absolutely talking and and and so therefore this is a potential solution to that issue but I tell you what could happen right which is really interesting if you end up with AIS right out there influencing and partnering with Brands right the the most the area that most uses influences is lifestyle and second is beauty right the point is is that you trust influencers that's why they work are you going to trust an AI putting cream on their face saying my visible in my 40s lines have disappeared so actually that authenticity of the human I think will become even more valuable in the future so therefore therefore still Del a potential career path right we're going to move on to Mashable we're going to whip through a couple of these stories now Elon musk's X pushed a fake headline about Iran attacking Israel uh talk us through this because this is potential real world warning signal yeah and this is what actually people have been talking about for so long so the fact that we're just seeing it play out is actually really really sad um for for the people that have been in this space for years talking about this so essentially all that happened was that um there was content onx right that was fake news right the fact that it stated that Iran was responsible for these strikes actually that's the footage was from Ukraine I think uh launching strikes against Russians in Crimea um but anyway it was it was fake news and then grock which is uh Elon musk's big investment in generative AI um that operates on the X platform took essentially this content saw it as a trending topic made up this is an AI right made up its own headline made up its own contextualized story all fake news and then actually posted that to X users and and the problem with this obviously is it's dangerous and it reminds you of that 1938 a and Wells story where War of the Worlds right where he was on the radio and he was actually talking about martians and Aliens descending on Earth people tuned in a bit late and there was mass hysteria apparently people left their homes so how you can have an influence by posting fake news is real this is really dangerous and disinformation in fake news has to be tackled and we need to hurry up right in terms of Regulation and I mean you know ex ex is already in trouble with the EU at the moment and I think it's only a matter of time really you know for for other states to take action as well okay we're going to have a look at legislation attempts anyway The Verge a new Bill wants to reveal what's really inside AI training data so what's the attempt here yeah okay so this is very much linked to all of this right so the input data so what's happened here is Adam Schiff who is um I believe a you're going to correct me a Democrat sen Senator have I got that right but he's proposed a bill to the House of Representatives where essentially any generative AI platforms would have to list if the bill was passed so post Bill not not the current platforms with their current training data just to be clear um any copyright sources copyrighted sources that they've used to train their data models which actually gives you that transparency of what's been used right the EU already have this um in their in their drafts uh for the EU um AI act so so essentially it would it would it would put you on this Level Playing Field with the EU and the UK is saying that people in the UK saying we should hurry up as well and so it gives you that transparency of what has been the input content so when there are cases there are plenty of lawsuits at the moment for example John Grisham and a bunch of authors the New York Times has taken open AI to court it would give content creators and copyright holders the ability to to essentially check if their content has been used and if copyright has been infringed I see but it's not law yet so we keep an eye on it see how it see how it develops it's moving quickly okay uh we're going to stay in the US Texas is replacing thousands of human exam scorers with AI this is from Tech spot uh how is this going to work this is really interesting right so it does cost millions and millions of pounds in the UK dollars in the US all over the world to Mark exam scripts so they've changed the exam in Texas so that it has more long form answers so less multiple choice exact short answer and they're going to be using trained AI models to Mark students answers now before you look really skeptical okay what I would say is if you look at gcses in the UK in England for example if you look at the GCSE papers and long form answers for example in a history essay right actually it's pretty proven that marking can be a bit skew whiffing cases because you have the human marking and it can be sometimes quite subjective even if you have a rubric and a mark scheme and we've actually developed this sort of Technology at Cent as well when it comes to literacy what you do is you train your own proprietary models you don't just plug it into a GPT why because when a third party upgrades its own models actually you don't know what changes have been made and then you can see a prompt that you enter today could actually give you a completely different answer next time and then you use the exam scripts you look at the you essentially constantly have this human evaluation which is what Texas will do they've trained it on 3,000 transcripts they'll mark Mark and save lots of money and apparently need to use 2,000 people rather than 6,000 people this year but it actually is an ongoing investment because every time an exam takes place you take lots of scripts you look at the scripts where there was a low probability of those scripts being marked properly you retrain your models and it's an ongoing process very quickly that seems to make sense and I can't imagine marking script after script if you're a human teacher or exam is the most fun so that's po I bet some of them find it really fun actually I'm Jud it's an we have 30 seconds left do you want to watch some cute little robots playing football of course you do let's take a look at that right just in 20 seconds priia what's going on so essentially Deep Mind have built these mini robots playing football they use what's called Deep reinforcements learning it's a really really powerful technique in artificial intelligence where you look at all the permutations of how a football uh play might take place you reward the system or you punish it if it doesn't for example score a goal and then they're basically through Brute Force training it with tons and tons of data using deep learning as well so the technique is super interesting and here you go will will one of those be lifesized and play for Man United and help my team I don't know hopefully oh he's falling over again it is adorable when they fall over right priia amazing thank you so much we're are out of time

              " Document(page_content=\"let's turn to Taiwan rescue efforts are underway after a magnitude 7.4 earthquake there at least nine people were killed more than 1,000 others injured in the strongest Quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years more than 100 people are understood to be trapped in collapsed tunnels along the coastline and around 30 buildings are reported to have collapsed altogether our correspondent Shima Khalil reports on taiwan's East Coast the rescue operation continues in the most challenging of circumstances teams are searching for those still trapped but so much is in the way the huge destruction and the dozens of Tremors that followed I'm afraid of aftershocks and I don't know how bad the shaking will be and then the house is already a mess how do you get in there's no way to get in inan the worst hit City some people spent the night outdoors as the aftershocks continued this is the moment the earthquake hit as residents were getting ready to start their day the earthquake woke me up and we just stayed around here across from the night market it's terrible this earthquake is huge homes and businesses buckled leaving whole floors underground this partially collapsed building now left tilted and unstable threatens more damage with the continu Tremors but in taiwan's rugged mountainous East Coast it was the landslides that unleashed the most Terror the earthquake caused hundreds of them bringing huge rocks tumbling down valleys destroying roads and railway lines and blocking access to the area this beautiful landscape turned into a scene of horror and for those still trapped in collapsed tunnels and Roads that horror is not over yet shy Mahalo BBC News Tokyo let's speak to Nar Farm filmmaker who is in Taipei Nar it's good to have you with us again now since we last spoke uh what is the mood there and particularly now that there's still this rescue operation going on is that getting in the way of of feeling like there's some closure there and and the ability to move on yes um I think the people here feel quite anxious about um the rescue operation that is going on in h and um now if you know Taiwan uh it rains a lot in Taiwan and poan is not exception so today um I think that people expect a light rain there and with the terrain in palian is is going to be very difficult for rescue workers to get into the area that people are trapped um in the r um and also in mountainous areas is is also with Fallen rocks there's another danger for people to access the area um to put themselves in that risk of being squashed by by the Rocks as well uh so um people in Tai um I think feel a great Sympathy for the people in Juan they also um want the government to accelerate the effort to look for the people who are still missing uh besides that I think the life in taipe has returned to normal uh working around the city you'll see that nothing changed you know people uh don't talk much about the earthquake um they've been very resilient for many reasons and they say so uh in face of this disaster yeah that's that's really interesting you did say that yesterday that you were really struck by the resilience of the people around you clearly that's still the case uh as the aftermath becomes clearer uh they are saying that this is the worst quake in 25 years is that registering in in people's minds definitely people of older Generations all uh yesterday all talked about how they witnessed the earthquake back in 1999 um I met a man I spoke to a man who actually was in taum when the earth earthquake happened uh back then and he said that it was a huge shock um compared to it he said nothing really happened yesterday he said that you know people in Taiwan are have you know have great experience dealing with such disaster and that's that's why they feel in karma and also um there's been training there's been uh efforts by the authorities to fortify bu buildings here and create a very effective procedure to deal with disasters such as earthquake so luckily um it was uh there was no major damages to the city uh compared to the last time let's go to hen where our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes uh is there to speak to us and of course it's a City close to the Quakes epicenter Rupert uh it's good to have you on now we talked about those rescue efforts earlier in the program could you tell us uh what more we know about them yeah I can I mean here in the middle of qu and you can see what's going on behind me here they're Shoring up this building that was partially brought down by the Quake yesterday very sadly someone died inside that building uh because of the Quake they were trapped inside there yesterday here in Juan the search and rescue operation has really uh come to an end everybody's accounted for nine people are dead they're now securing the buildings and beginning the cleanup and it's been remarkable to see how quickly this city is getting back to business but outside the city uh there is a a huge search and rescue operation going on in the mountains and we've got some new figures just in the last hour the authorities are now saying 42 people missing but the number of people trapped up there in The Valleys not far away from here has left from around 100 to they're now saying over 600 646 people now confirmed as trapped probably that's because they've been able to contact people as the cell phone network has come back to life and they're calling people and finding they're trapped in hotels uh and in villages up in the mountains but that is a huge leap in the number of people trapped and a huge issue to try and get to them and make sure they're okay yeah that's a really high figure we were actually just speaking to someone in Taipei who was telling us that people are watching and following this uh what are the conversations you've been having there uh on day two of all of this well I think it's really the sense of shock still many people espe if you're under 30 years old you've never experienced anything like this before because the last time they had a big earthquake like this in Taiwan was back in 1999 so you know when you see pictures you may have seen uh you know people talking uh on TV saying I was really scared I didn't know what to do it was absolutely terrifying I think that's you know that's a very very normal reaction because a people are not used to an earthquake of this size and even in taipe yesterday it was really really a big shake and the second thing is however much Taiwan is in an earthquake zone that people say they're used to earthquakes when a big one like this hits it is absolutely terrifying and traumatizing for everybody who experiences it right riet thank you for that and of course

United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you\", metadata={'source': 'Cg3YMWcjLI4', 'title': \"US President Joe Biden

              " Document(page_content=\"right we're going to look now at UK US diplomacy because foreign secretary David Cameron is the latest European leader to make the trip to Washington just a few hours ago he met US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin here talks focused on well the two major conflicts bringing stability to the Middle East and the war in Ukraine now Republican lawmakers have been holding up a proposed 60 billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine for months Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson has n let the Ukraine Aid issue be debated in the House of Representatives as yet now Lord Cameron said it wasn't for foreign politicians to tell uh lawmakers In Another Country what to do but he urged Congress to see the funding released I think it is absolutely interests of US security uh that Putin fails in his illegal Invasion I think it's good for us jobs uh that we continue to back uh Ukraine with the weapons that they need and I think in terms of how the United States the United Kingdom as allies are seen around the world um there will be people in Teran in pongyang in Beijing looking at how we stand by our allies how we help them how we stop this uh illegal and unprovoked aggression and working out whether we are committed whether we're prepared to see it through and Mr blinkin said they' also talked about ways to prevent the transfer of weapons to Russia particularly from China and North Korea this is an ongoing challenge uh and we see um weapons U we also see Technologies to support the defense industrial base in uh Russia coming from North Korea from Iran from China this is an area of particular concern for not only the United States and the United Kingdom but many of our allies and partners throughout Europe let's speak now to our state department correspondent Tom baitman hi Tom so what should we take away from that pressure conference well the most significant bit of news was an answer to M that Lord Cameron gave to a question I asked him in the Press briefing there which was about the growing pressure on the UK government to Halt armed sales to Israel around the issue of whether or not Israel had been deemed by the UK to be in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza now um Lord Cameron had said on the 8th of March that he would receive legal advice within days about that issue but here we are a month later and there had still been no announcement so I asked him that question what um did the UK government deem um Israel to have done when it came to International humanitarian law and he confirmed in his answer that the UK would continue to supply weapons to Israel and therefore that a review had taken place and my understanding is these are fairly broad not just legal reviews but also policy-based reviews and under that uh the UK would continue to um uh sell uh what is around a 35 million pound a year uh trade in weapons to the Israelis but he also said that they continue to have concerns about the issue and they would continue to review it um so that was there too but that was a significant uh moment in that news briefing there okay Tom thank you very much for that going to take a look now at the issue of ukra ukine we can speak to a global Affairs analyst and Senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Michael bosu who's in Odessa in Ukraine thank you very much for coming on the program my pleasure good to be with you so let's talk about this issue of politicians going from one country to another saying well we can't tell you what to do but you really ought to do this basically Lord Cameron today in Washington urging well expressing his support for Ukraine and urging the us to do the same how do you find that balance that diplomatic balance well it was very entertaining I think Lord Cameron was being very tight lipped about his trip to Florida but I am quite sure I would bet money on it that he told Mr Trump exactly what's going to happen if that 60 billion dollar in Aid which is being blocked by his mother Republicans will not reach Ukraine and I noticed that both um ministers made the point that a lot of this money that is your mark for Ukraine is not going to be loaded on to pallets and you know airlifted to Ukraine it's actually going to stay in the United States and create jobs that's a message that the American public needs to hear but um the other quick thing that came out is I noticed uh Lord Cameron was almost ahead of his count us counterpart Mr blink in terms of his conviction in terms of his passion in terms of the arguments made for Aid to Ukraine it's almost as if the Americans were a bit hedgy about it but Lord Cameron really his message really came through that if this war is not stopped if this Aid is not delivered Putin will go further and it will become a lot more cost C for everybody and the potential hesitancy yes there's diplomatic politics at play there's Party politics at play is it simple geography as well country is far away seen as a far away problem oh yeah absolutely uh the message I got out of today more clearly than ever is that it it is now the United Kingdom and Europe that are going to take the lead on the so-called ukra file in terms of helping Ukraine for example booler their domestic production of ammunition but um the other thing that came through is I think Lord Cameron rightly tiptoed through everything because it is a very complicated Diplomat sorry political scene in the United States right now where the man who has basic control over this vote speaker Johnson I think he does support Ukraine I think he does have the votes to make that bill pass I think he knows that uh the US public support this but he's prioritizing his own political future over everything else that he wants to remain important in that Trump wing of the Republican party and what's going to happen there if he continues along this path I think people will see him as a man who could not summon the DI the political courage to do the right thing and hence this war will continue to go on for a lot longer than it has to and what do you think the implications would be for Ukraine if Trump won the presidency well absolutely horrible he views himself as the master of the art of the deal he will try to bring it to resolution in 24 hours uh leaked reports from closed door conversations he's had indicate what most of us believe is that he'll give into territorial concessions Crimea will remain in Russian hands uh the donbas other areas that Russia has seized including that crucial land bridge between the Russian Mainland and um and the western part of Ukraine and uh he'll probably um give the signals to Mr Putin that he can go even further I mean there's a lot of nervousness I have to tell you right here in Odessa we've had alarms air rate alarms uh most of the day and night and missiles coming this way it's it's not going the right way whatsoever well I just want to just very briefly just expand on exactly that because I wanted to highlight that that is exactly where you are and ask a bit about what life is like and how it is going right now a couple of things I mean I'm very close to to the port and these strikes tend to uh Target electrical infrastructure if there's no power there's no Port uh at working and there's no grain going to World Markets uh the other thing on the other side of the country in khu it's really hell on Earth um being bombed relentlessly it does look like the Russians are on an L campaign to turn it into a a piece of rubble of gry Zone and possibly even encircle it uh so very very bad news coming out of hard tonight as well Michael bosu we really appreciate your time thank you\", metadata={'source': 'yQIMSv9Luw4', 'title': \"Lord

              " Document(page_content=\"shares in social media platform Reddit start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday in its initial public offering or IPO and if you're not familiar with Reddit it hosts Niche discussion groups or subreddits around a 100,000 of them on everything from politics to pets investing and hobbies in the world of Co in the words of co-founder and boss Steve Huffman Reddit topics range from the sublime to the ridiculous the trivial to the existential the IC to the serious around 73 million people use it every day so what's it worth Reddit has priced its shares at $34 giving it a stock market value of $6.4 billion at the start of trading that could of course go up or down once shares start trading but it is well below the $10 billion valuation given to Reddit by investors back in 2021 and to put all that in perspective social media giant meta which owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp was worth $1.2 trillion at the market close on Wednesday let's go live to Paul condra he's head of industry and Technology research at pitchbook which provides data on the global Capital markets and he's in Seattle Port Reddit may not be as famous as Facebook Instagram or X but it has 1.2 billion subscribers and an oversubscribed public listing so it's clearly a hot ticket is it scalable though can it reach the heights of those bigger companies uh well yeah I mean thanks for having me I think if you look at the daily active user count it's much lower than some of those larger properties you mentioned at about 70 73 million versus you know up into the billions for a company like meta and I think it caters to a much more Niche um type of use case um and the type of contributors and moderators that kind of want to run their subreddits um the way they see fit and they want to have more control over it whereas when you look at a you know a Facebook or an Instagram it's much more centrally managed so it's it's a different kind of business model um and I think it draws people in slowly but it also draws a lot of people in um that maybe want to get information quickly and get out because the kind of stickiness factors that exist in uh some of these larger platforms don't really exist in Reddit so yeah the opportunity really is you know how much do they want to go down that road of trying to use some of the techniques and models that some of their larger counterparts are using to make the platform stickier to make it a little more of an entertainment type of platform bring users in and try to monetize it a bit more effectively than they have in the past exactly I mean Paul you mentioned its business model and the fact that it needs to monetize it it doesn't make a profit it hasn't made a profit we've got a more competitive advertising Market it's signed this $60 million reported deal with allowing its data for training Google's AI models it's obviously got very valuable data from these discussions but I mean how is it going to raise the bottom line yeah I mean the the the the model was never really built to optimize advertising right it was built to provide a platform for creators and contributors and moderators kind of a decentralized um conversation space where people can be kind of have free reign on the things that they want to talk about and now so there now there's a bit of a pivot taking place uh for a company that wants to go public and wants to optimize that platform more effectively um they just raised a lot of money so that means they've got some Capital uh or they will have once this IPO is completed um they don't have any debt uh and so they've got the ability now to invest in the resources to say look we've got the traffic we've got the platform um but we don't really have is an advertising machine that really is optimized and capitalizes on that on what we have there so we can put the people and teams in place to start investing on that and they probably can make progress are they going to be able to grow it faster or take a bigger share of the market from their bigger competitors probably not but they can they can most likely turn that into a stronger business than what it is now um and then there's these secondary revenue streams that they're they've made some progress on which is selling the data um and that's become obviously very important in the last couple years with the rise of generative Ai and they have a pretty unique um data set a lot of IP on unique um valuable information across all these subreddits uh it's already proven to be somewhat valuable to Google who signed kind of a $60 million deal with them this year that can be an interesting Revenue stream probably a much higher margin Revenue stream I think there's a lot of questions around how big that can be but if we're just looking in the next couple years I think there's a lot of reasons this company can kind of put the pedal down in terms of generating more revenue and increasing the margin profile and and those are things to get people or at least get investors excited when you look at a valuation that's coming to the market that's not terribly expensive um to say hey this could be a good run for the next couple years it's probably not going to reach the scale of meta um but could be a good solid business if they're able to execute on those plans right and

weekend from Iran damage on the ground was limited damage to Regional stability much more severe at an air base hit by missiles in the neav desert today Israel's Chief of Staff promised a response Iran will face the consequences for its actions we will choose our response accordingly the IDF remains ready to counter any threat from Iran and its Terror proxies Israel says only a half handful of missiles made it through air defenses but this direct confrontation with Iran the First on Israeli soil has thrown the Middle East off balance what's shaken Israel in these attacks isn't the damage caused but how they happened with drones and missiles sent straight from Iran and what these strikes left broken isn't so much infrastructure it's Iran's fear of launching a direct attack Iran's attack came with careful signaling its government warned Israel's allies of the strikes and said they were punishment for an assassination in Syria and that Iran now considered the matter closed our advice to all the supporters of the Zionist regime is to appreciate Iran's responsible and measured action and dissuade the Zionist regime from committing more wicked acts which would bring incalculable consequences but Israel has said it will exact a price from Iran its prime minister under pressure from allies to deescalate the situation has been discussing with his War cabinet exactly what that price should Beal one former Diplomat with experience of Iran says military action is only one option our military options are far more varied than the Iranians um and frankly the Iranian uh barrage was a a demonstration of weakness not of strength there's clearly uh a strong need for Israel to uh however it decides to respond and the respond can response can come in many different ways not just military Israel is already fighting iranian-backed groups in Gaza to the South and Lebanon to the north a far less powerful opponent delivered a major blow on the 7th of October Israel's challenge now is how to restore a fear of conflict in its biggest enemy without triggering a war Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem our International editor Jeremy Bowen is here so as we heard Jeremy Israel continuing to insist it will retaliate even while the US is saying Iran has embarrassed itself well I think they're trying to get the message over to the Israelis that look yes your right to be concerned you have been attacked but this is under control look Iran's embarrassed itself it's not that simple though for the Israelis uh I think they feel the need very strongly to send a signal a really determined signal that they uh are not deterred in any sense by Iran there's something very deep in Israel's DNA that it has to push back it's not a question of turning the other cheek it's an eye for an eye at least uh that is something which is really part of their ethos but the gamble is always how is the other side going to respond because as you've heard the Iranians are also saying hang on this was self-defense we were just doing it to make a point also to restore to Terence and I think what they were also trying to do was uh to avoid making causing a large numbers of Civilian casualties which would have escalated matters so Israel is having those same similar kinds of discussions about the way that they need to go the Iranian Army Chief has said today in the last few hours he said something like our attack on Israel was limited if Israel retaliates there will be a far greater response you know from netanyahu's point of view for many years he has seen Iran as Israel's number one enemy bana I remember him saying to me in the BBC office in Jerusalem about about 2006 when armad was President he said look armad had is Hitler and it's 1938 you know it wasn't an exclusive he was saying it a lot at the time to people but that's very much his view now don't forget there's also the war in Gaza going on that's something which is still urgent it's still there's still the famine there is still military action going on there in the middle part of the Gaza Strip but as far as Israel's uh Western allies are concerned it is less of a priority these last few days than Iran Iran seems a lot more urgent doesn't mean to say that they've forgotten about what's going on there but instead of talking about differences potential war crimes famines they're talking about Unity coalitions facing Iran together\", metadata={'source': 'lHggWT2iLdo', 'title': 'Israel’s top general says Iran faces retaliation despite calls for restraint | BBC News', 'description':

              " Document(page_content=\"you are watching the context it's time for our new weekly segment AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence we're going to start with a Guardian newspaper it says according to Israeli intelligence sources Israel's military has been using an AI tool known as lavender to identify Hamas targets across Gaza Israel has rejected this and has released a statement which reads the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives next we have an opinion piece in the new Statesman why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence it asks whether existential anxiety about AI is just the patriarchy's fear of itself in a few minutes uh we see a robot called sfia respond to a question about how AI can come up with a road map to a more Equitable Society the Ft reports the US and the UK have signed a landmark agreement on artificial intelligence are becom the first countries to formally cooperate on how to test and assess risks from emerging AI models in the Wall Street Journal is the internet big enough to satisfy the huge appetite for data the world's leading AI companies need to grow the times reports more than 200 musicians asking technology companies to stop using their songs to train artificial intelligence models artists like Billy ish and RM are warning the music ecosystem is at risk of Destruction and finally are you ready for your fast food to be cooked by robots a US convenience chain says it's installed an AI powerered robotic system to give customers quote fully customizable fried chicken french fries and other items we'll show you that later with me is Stephanie hair technology author and AI commentator Stephanie great to have you as always uh should we start with a very sobering story on the front of the Guardian newspaper yes so we are looking at a new frontier in the field of warfare which is and it must be said that the Israeli Defense Force has denied this story but in the story which claims to site six Israeli Intelligence Officers who've all used a system called lavend to identify human targets and that's not particularly new the IDF has been using AI to identify buildings and structures as targets that was a system called The Gospel this new system though is called lavender and the differences rather than picking a build a building to attack or blow up they're going after humans so the question becomes who's responsible and who's making these decisions and is there proper human oversight the article would suggest not these six Intelligence Officers in the story claimed that they were spending about 20 seconds maximum to approve the targets that the AI was deciding for assassination that's time time scales will raise some eyebrows certainly just want to bring you the response quoted in the Guardian newspaper from uh the Israeli Army the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist adding information systems are merely tools for analysts in the Target identification process right let's move on to the front of the new Statesman this is one of those headlines isn't it why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence is strong enough but then the sub headline there existential anxiety about AI is just patriarchy's fear of itself Stephanie talk us through this I mean as a feminist this is a particularly enjoyable article to read but then with my British sense of fair play I had to go hm are we really saying that AI would be better designed if it was only being designed by women for instance or only people who are left-handed or only Americans versus peruvians so we have to really ask what is this article arguing for so it says you know projection is a mental process by which people attribute to others what they would actually do themselves so when you have a bunch of male billionaires the article argues not me I should say worrying about existential risk and domination the author makes the analogy that that's really because that's what an Elon Musk would do or that's what a Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg would do but it's not necessarily what all of us would do and hopefully not what a diverse inclusive team would do so it's really a call for diversity interest and that's real psychology isn't it it's basically going inside the brains of these people who are in charge and thinking what they're most scared of is a projection of their biggest weaknesses is and so therefore it's power and domination and so you've made the caveat that this not you where where do you stand on that as a as a theory though is it something that I mean presumably you're going to support diversity in of the people making these big decisions yes but not in a sort of politically correct woke way that some people might get very nervous about I'm actually looking at it in the perspective that we have here in this country with gchq which is neurodiverse teams more diverse teams perform better than monocultural teams because they see the world differently and in the domain of cyber security which is what gchq is all about keeping the country safe you need different perspectives to identify risk okay so it's a danger to just have group think I see okay well we know what the article thinks we now know what you think should we see what AI thinks now Bloomberg did a series where they asked a an AI robot Sophia um a series of questions one of them was how to make an AI system more Equitable potentially let's take a listen come up with a road map not just with a goal but with a road map for a more Equitable uh Society AI definitely has the potential to contribute to a more Equitable Society but it requires a collective effort and the inclusion of diverse perspectives we need to set ambitious goals for AI that prioritize issues like causing Global fairness and climate impact a road map can guide us towards achieving these goals and ensuring that AI serves the greater good Stephanie I don't want to say you could be replaced but that answer sounded a lot like the your answer I don't know what that means I don't know who came up with it first it might be a trained off of my book well good point good point right let's move to something potentially really important we've been following legislation attempts at regulation of course uh over the weeks and months us and UK signed Landmark agreement on testing safety of AI this is in the Ft what's this about I love this story it's all about how the US and the UK always want to be the first at having a safety Summit and now they're the first to agree that they're going to test AI but then you actually go into the article the United States AI safety Summit has actually done no work on this since the summit that we had back in November so they're signing lots of stuff but nobody's doing anything when you actually look into it they don't have the budget or the staff yet I'm sure the United States has other things going on so we can feel that this is hopeful but are we reassured I would say the jury is still out on this but it's still exciting to see countries committing to it and other governments will watch and the idea is I was at Bletchley Park for the for the UK and the signing and the announcements and the Great and the good were there and the idea is that rather than let private companies develop all this AI on their own actually they'll hand it over and so that the governments or government people uh who they're appointing can have a look inside and check it's actually safe is that right yes and the idea is that the US needs to be involved it can't just be the UK because most big AI companies or companies using AI are American but we have to acknowledge China is not anywhere involved in this agreement nor was it really involved with the summit very much and that is an AI superpower so again no resting on laurels when it comes to AI safety and as a principle do you think this model is going to be enough because like you say at the moment you're skeptical of resources and and uh time spent on it so far but let's presume that that does all come the agreements continue and they work together is it enough to warn and warn off the potential worst downsides of AI I would argue no we've got the EU AI act coming on quite soon the finalizing of that's happening this spring and a couple of years implementation that's a start but you know there's no rush to regulate here in the UK there's no rush to regulate in the United States so how are people going to be able to Sue how are they going to be getting responsibility and liability for when AI goes wrong and that's just in in the countries I've just listed AI is a global phenomenon it's like public health or climate change is going to have to involve every country on earth I think we're just at the beginning of building our AI sa safety infrastructure and just very lastly and quickly on this because you me things like China now China were invited I remember to BL part to day one of the summit but not today to when they've really talked about more sensitive things how do you see China and other countries working with China well right now it's very awkward because China keeps stealing people's data and launching cyber security attacks and then getting caught for it so it's hard to work with them and have trust at the same time they can't be left out of the discussion we're constantly working to find common ground with them and we must respect the work that they're doing some of it's very impressive interesting right let's move on to Wall Street Journal because this is interesting for data guzzling AI companies the internet is too small what what does that mean the internet is too small I love that it's like you know water water everywhere and not a drop to drink this is you think the internet has loads of data and you think that the world existence not just human but all of it is something that could be datafied and it could but it hasn't yet and that's what this article makes so beautiful most of the data available online is useless for AI training because it contains flaws it's not structured properly um this researcher who's quoted thinks that it's about a tenth of the information gathered is useful most of what's on the Internet is garbage who knew wow and so is there any kind of solution of course um there's going to be a whole field some of the most Cutting Edge research is going to be looking to structure data to create synthetic data which is where it's actually generated from within a company rather than going out and getting it and extracting it we are again on the cusp of this so I love that we've identified the problem it the problem answers with a solution we will have a new field being created interesting well that feeds into this next story which is something again we are going to continue to return to musicians from Billy eish to AR M unite to demand protection from AI so this is AI going out and crawling the internet and these artists these musicians want it to stop well I mean quite and it's not just musicians it's actors it's it's writers whose books might be being copied and turn into Bloomberg videos you just don't know do you because there's no real regulation there's no playing field on this so right now you've got the New York Times suing Microsoft and open AI saying you can't train on the New York Times so until we get a couple of loss suits that finally make a decision that's one way of solving it or we can have what the musicians are asking for which is kind of like a good behavior pledge that always works very well um right or we could get some actual laws passed so again let's see how it plays out and specifically on the music then you've got AI going out and listening to Billy eish or whatever and and using that to do what to try and come up with his with its own songs so many things so you could be impersonating a singer so like take take a great song like Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin and give me the version as sung by Dolly Parton which I would love to hear by the way so you could do that but does Miss Parton get paid for that does le zeppin get paid for that did they have consent in that Etc somebody could put that on the internet and I'm sure will right now after putting it out right like it'ss just that quickly uh that you can do this so that's one thing but it could also be training off of their lyrics and even off of their musical composition and Arrangement which is that's their proprietary product and and so is the is the potential end game I don't know whether it is anyone's end game that but that it could learn AI would learn all the different styles off all the different artists out there and then basically just keep on generating its own music and we would go on to whatever our music playlists are and just listen to AI generated stuff and we don't need any well I think it could get quite derivative it's sometimes like when your favorite band maybe goes on too long and needs to stop touring it could just sometimes they have a golden period and you wish they'd stopped no I'm I'm not commenting on any of that right we've got one one last article to look out this is The Verge now there's an AI gas station with robot fry Cooks uh we'll take a look at it in action whilst you explain what's going on so okay okay sorry so this robot is g to be making your chicken wings for you to be honest it can make any food and Fries um obviously there's not going to be any fun banter with this chef but efficient and in theory controlled product every time so you would be able to get the same thing if you gave it specification I wanted Cajun I wanted jerk chicken I wanted you know tender um dark meat only Etc so why is that interesting fully customizable fried chicken and french fries I mean don't get me wrong I love both of these things dearly a the the realm of variety isn't as big as you'd think and B do you need a robot for that is that a problem that needs solving is that a problem that needs solving that's a good question to end on I'm afraid we are out of time Stephan thank you so much we are out of time we'll do the same again next\", metadata={'source': 'h-5dqQMZTZQ', 'title': 'AI Safety: UK and US sign

              " Document(page_content=\"right we're going to start in the US and this show of unity that we've seen just in the last couple of hours between Japan and the US military cooperation between the two countries top of the agenda of course in the background tensions with China never far from the mind with well a number of Western governments right let's take a look at what's been happening there we go President Biden is hosting Japan's prime minister fumio kashida there at the White House there have been military guards of Honor they also be a state dinner in the next couple of hours now the talks are part of the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts in Asia there were recent war games in Soul and take a look at these pictures this is the weekend the US Japan Philippines and Australia held joint military exercises in the South China Sea the Chinese military conducted combat Patrols in the same area and speaking a little earlier President Biden said Japan the US and Australia will together boost military capabilities including uh through the creation of an air missile Network Biden said the upgrades were defensive in nature this is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of since it was first established I'm also pleased to announce that for the first time Japan and the United States and Australia will create a network system of air missile and defense architecture we're also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom and our Aus defense partnership with Australia in the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar which focuses on Advanced capabilities including AI autonomous systems all told that represents a new Benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities right let's speak to Mary mcarthy professor of political science Drake University specializing in Japan's domestic and foreign policy thank you very much for coming on the program thank you so much for having me right there were lots of words that Joe Biden was just saying trilateral capabilities uh lots of other slightly jargony technical missile capabilities can you please attempt to explain that for us well I think the to start off we have to say that the meeting this week between Biden and kashida coming on the heel of these military exercises that were just mentioned is extremely important it is a signal to both domestic and international audiences we know that one of the target audiences is certainly China but it's not only China it's the International System in general as well as domestic audiences in the US and in Japan and and so I think that the second important thing to really highlight is that the announcements today are not coming out of nowhere out of the blue they are the culmination of months of hard work by the Biden and kishida administrations as well as the governments in Australia in the Philippines and elsewhere and so this is so let's just focus on on exactly that the mention there of Australia the mention of uh the UK Britain will hold regular joint military exercises in the Indo Pacific with the US and Japan from 2025 uh to boost Security in the region that's from the uh Ministry of Defense here in the UK that role with Australia too as well as Japan where does all this leave China so I think it has become increasingly clear that so-called likeminded states in the Asia Pacific are cooperating and coordinating more closely certainly on defense and security but also on what is now called Economic Security resilient Supply chains closer economic relationships and we see Japan and Australia both taking clear steps to be in lock step with the US with regard to its position in the Asia Pacific and seeing China today as a strategic challenge or perhaps even a strategic threat whereas previously there was a lot more efforts on the part of Japan and Australia to enhance the partnership elements of their relationships with China yeah lots of uh political discourse based around the difference between the world word challenge and threat we haven't got time to go into that now because I want to talk about space that was mentioned astronauts us Japan cooperation is this something we should read anything into it is I think it represents two important elements of the US Japan relationship one is that the relationship is multifaceted it is not only a security relationship it is not only an economic relationship there are so many issues on which the US and Japan are should and could be cooperating and space is one and the second important thing to keep in mind is that space is not something frivolous oh oh it'll be great the Japanese astronaut will be on the Moon

              " Document(page_content=\"a landmarked judgment at the European Court of human rights which ruled that Switzerland violated the human rights of a group of elderly women by failing to adequately fight climate change well the court said that Switzerland's efforts to meet its emission reduction targets had been woefully inadequate the Judgment also ruled that the women had been denied access to justice as their case had been rejected by all Swiss courts well we recently heard from the Swiss president Viola amard who said sustainability biod diversity and Net Zero are very important to Switzerland she said the country would continue to keep working on them well that came as two other cases were ruled inadmissible now in those six Portuguese Youth and a French mayor were also attempting to force their governments and others in Europe to take more ambitious action to fight climate change well in a moment we will hear from a climate change lawyer but first let's have a listen to climate activist Greta tunberg who shared her reaction to today's verdicts today's rulings make very clear that European states have a legal responsibility to take real climate action and to protect people and to protect its citizens um it cannot be a political Choice whether to respect human rights or not Greta tunberg there will Tessa CS an international climate change lawyer and the executive director of uplift it's a climate campaign group I spoke to her earlier about these cases well it's a case that was brought um on behalf of a large group of elderly Swiss women um on the basis that older women in particular are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change we've seen for example with heat waves that are driven or made more intense by climate change that when those hit it's often the elderly and elderly women in particular whose Health suffers and so they've brought this case arguing that Switzerland uh climate change policies its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions uh is inadequate to protect the health the housing the human rights of Swiss women and they've succeeded and the courts confirmed today that it is a legally binding obligation that governments have to make sure that their climate change policies are sufficient to protect people's human rights so it's a really significant finding you say it's significant Tessa but how of it is actually symbolic what would the Swiss government now have to do following this ruling well like any government that is found to be in breach of its legal obligations it's now under an obligation to align its action with what the law requires so what's clear although you know I'm yet to read the 100 Page Plus judgment in detail but in the past when courts have made these sorts of findings and they have made these sorts of findings in other countries in the past it requires governments to be more ambitious in terms of their policies to cut carbon emissions they've got to stop burning fossil fuels at the pace that they currently do so the path of action is very clear and Tessa it wasn't all good news for people filing those cases today we had some young people in Portugal and a mayor in France whose cases were ruled inadmissible once again if you could just tell us a little bit about those two cases yeah certainly so the case on behalf of Portuguese young people was brought again because there was real concern that the way that the impacts of climate change have been playing out in Portugal which is you know increasingly intense and frequent wildfires heat waves those are having really tangible impacts on the lives and on the health of young people in Portugal and so again they've argued that it's a breach of their human rights in this instance the court didn't make any finding as to whether or not um the portug government or any other European government is in fact breaching their human rights they simply made a finding that those young people should have ventilated that claim they should have gone first to court in Portugal before going to a higher Court which is the European Court of Human Rights so they didn't actually engage with the merits of that argument at all they simply said that it wasn't the right Forum in which to hear that claim and you work in this field uh of legal uh cases around climate are we likely to see more of these kind of cases coming up how widespread um is it for people around the world to bring such cases well we absolutely will see more of these kinds of cases it's already a widespread phenomenon there are literally dozens of cases that are currently playing out in countries around the world it's not just limited to the UK and Europe although there is an active case in UK Courts at the moment challenging the robustness and the credibility of the UK government's climate change policy but you know we've seen cases in Latin America in Africa in Australia in the US they are everywhere and the findings of the Court the European Court of Human Rights today will I think only underline that this is an issue that rises to the question of whether or not governments are acting lawfully and inevitably I think we will see as people get more and more desperate as they continue to see governments failing to act with the seriousness and the speed that's required they will inevitably turn to courts more and more\", metadata={'source': 'wMqJbMPNM6A', 'title': 'European court rules human rights violated by climate inaction in landmark case | BBC News', 'description': 'Unknown',

              " Document(page_content=\"[Music] than 100 countries that is in large part due to the success of the iPhone Apple's signature smartphone product for over a decade iPhone sales have made up a majority of Apple's annual revenue today Apple's share of the US performance smartphone market exceeds 70% and its share of the entire us smartphone market exceeds 65% Apple charges as much as nearly $1600 for an iPhone but as our complaint alleges Apple has maintain Monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating Federal antitrust law consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law we allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary anti-competitive conduct that hurts both consumers and Developers for consumers that has meant fewer choices higher prices in fees lower quality smartphones apps and accessories and less Innovation from Apple and its competitors for developers that has meant being forced to play by rules that insulate Apple from competition and as outlined in our complaint we allege that Apple has Consolidated its Monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse Apple carries out its exclusionary anti-competitive conduct in two principal ways first Apple imposes contractual restrictions and fees that limit the features and functionality that developer can offer iPhone users second Apple selectively restricts access to the points of connection between third-party apps and the iPhone's operating system degrading the functionality of non-apple apps and accessories as a result for most of the past 15 years Apple has collected a tax in the form of a 30% Commission on the price of any app downloaded from the App Store as well as on inapp purchases apple is able to command these fees from companies of all sizes Apple has also suppressed the emergence of programs like Cloud streaming apps including gaming apps as well as super apps that could reduce user dependence on Apple's own operating system and expensive hardware and as any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message or received a tiny grainy video can attest Apple's anti-competitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-apple products it does this by diminishing the functionality of its own messaging app and by diminishing the functionality of third-party messaging apps by doing so Apple knowingly and deliberately degrades quality privacy and security for its users for example if an iPhone user messages a non-phone user in apple messages the text appears not only as a green bubble but incorporates limited functionality the conversation is not in red videos are pixelated and grainy and users cannot edit messages or see typing indicators as a result iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse even though apple is the one responsible for breaking crossplatform messaging and it does so intentionally for example in 2013 a senior executive at Apple explained that supporting crossplatform messaging in apple messages quote would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones close quote in 2022 Apple's CEO was asked whether Apple would fix iPhone to Android messaging the questioner added quote not to make it personal but I can't send my mom certain videos close quote Apple's CEO CEO responded buy your mom and iPhone in addition to selectively controlling app distribution and creation we allege that apple is violating the law by conditionally restricting developers access to the interface which is needed to make an app functional on the Apple operating system for a product like a smartwatch or a digital wallet to be useful to an iPhone user it must be able to communicate with the iPhone's operating system but Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem when it comes to SmartWatches Apple not only drives users to purchase an Apple Watch which is only compatible with an iPhone it also uses its Technical and contractual controls to make it harder for someone with an iPhone to use a non-apple smartwatch and when it comes to digital wallets Apple's exclusionary conduct goes a step further digital wallets allow users to store and use passes and credentials in a single app including credit cards personal identification movie tickets and car keys Apple wallet is Apple's proprietary digital wallet on the iPhone Apple actively encourages Banks merchants and other parties to participate in apple wallet but it's simultaneously exerts its Monopoly power to block these same Partners from developing alternative payment products and services for iPhone users for example Apple has blocked thirdparty developers from creating competing digital Wallets on the iPhone they use what is known as tap to pay functionality that is the function that makes a digital wallet well a wallet instead Apple forces those who want to use the wallet function to share personal information with apple even if they would prefer to share that information solely with their Bank medical provider or other trusted third party when an iPhone user puts a credit or debit card in apple wallet Apple inserts itself into the process that would otherwise occur directly between the user and the card issuer this introduces an additional potential point of failure for the privacy and security of Apple users and that is just one way in which apple is willing to make the iPhone less secure and less private in order to maintain its Monopoly power the Supreme Court defines Monopoly power as quote the power to control prices or exclude competition as set out in our complaint Apple has that power in the smartphone market now having Monopoly power does not itself violate the antitrust laws but it does when a firm acquires or maintains Monopoly power not because it has a superior product or Superior business acument but by engaging in exclusionary conduct as set out in our complaint Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority because of its unlawful exclusionary Behavior monopolies like apples threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based they stifle Innovation they hurt producers and workers and they increase costs for consumers if left unchallenged Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone Monopoly but there's a law for that the justice department will vigorously enforce and I trust law enforcing the law protects consumers from higher prices and fewer choices that is a Justice Department's legal obligation that is what the American people expect that is what they deserve\", metadata={'source':

              " Document(page_content=\"uh yeah first up let's start with Boeing all change the playmaker has revealed that its chief executive David Calhoun will leave by the end of this year the company also said the boss of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for reelection The Firm of course is under pressure after a door panel on a plane blew out in midair in January no one was injured during the incident but the firm's safety record has come under renewed scrutiny well let's get more on this now from John Grant who's an independent Aviation analyst good afternoon to you and firstly change at the top does often follow this sort of thing doesn't it but do you think this will address the underlying issues here regarding safety but it's John strippin by the way rather than John Grant oh apologies John my apologies I badly misinformed there but so yeah there has been these underlying issues hasn't there uh with the technical side of things safety wise yeah do you feel like this will convince people I think this marks a fundamental change and of course we're talking about a time scale the head of boing commercial airplanes leaving immediately the CEO still in post till the end of the year I'm not normally a person who would flippantly say regime change is necessary but I think this is very very symbolic and critical to Boeing's Rehabilitation to go back to position of where it was a preeminent industry manufacturing known for quality and obviously above all safety we've seen so much much going on in the last couple of years since we had the the grounding of the the max eight aircraft after two fatal crashes we've had the last few months one day after another news flow since we had the door come out of the Alaska 737 I think what this does is send a message in every respect internally to the workforce that at the top things are changing it's a break from the past outwardly both to uh Airline customers many of whom have been critical uh of the business if not directly calling for the head of the CEO and the head of commercial airplanes and of course to to the traveling public as well and and indeed Wall Street so it's going to take some months to do and I think what we need to do is look to the Future and make sure that now this this is going to happen that the right people are indeed appointed to have the right skill set the right experience to lead going forward take it out of this very unfortunate period of years it's experienced recently uh what do you think the impact might be on passengers when we see major surgery needed like this does tend to hit uh the production line for example and then that Finds Its way through the tickets well there should be no effect on on production I mean it is a technical business for our production processes of course the focus for spotlight is already on quality the lack of quality the the failures we've seen that have led to the most recent accident for example that work has to continue Dave cohon while he is still CEO has said that he'll do everything possible to ensure that it's put right the removal of executives below him now including Stan deal head of commercial airplanes recently the head of the 737 program the one which is primarily of a spotlight have happened but those processes have to continue to be one adhered to strengthened we have The Regulators not least for FAA looking with close scrutiny boeings in the midst of a 90-day period when he has to come up with an action plan to put these things right so it has to continue deliveries are still taking place to airlines that in itself is a challenge for many delays a lot of unhappy C customers including Ryan Air for example but from a customer point of view yeah maybe there could be some peripheral impact on ticket prices this summer because capacity tight we've again already heard that from Ry a and others Boeing is not alone in in having aircraft with uh technical challenges this sub capacity is tight but I think uh daytoday the industry will perform within those constraints as it otherwise would okay John listen John Strickland there Strickland thank you very much indeed for your time there for analysis on Boeing well let's uh get a bit more reaction from New York on this I think we can cross now to Michelle flurry our North America business correspondent Michelle uh early days on the stock market I guess the reaction though has been been pretty good so far uh will this be enough do you think to to convince shareholders investors I I mean I think there's a sense at least initially uh from analysts and investors that this will kind of help the share price uh in part uh they think it's a positive shake up for Boeing uh that this is a step forward in an attempt to win back trust um that being said though it is just a first step you know I wanted to read you a sort of quote we had from someone throwing a bit of skepticism um saying look uh there could be some cultural change happening at boing we've long thought that the issues at Boeing have been seated in cultural challenges that was Cameron Dawson um who is Chief investment officer at New Age wealth I think a lot will depend on who Calhoun's successor ultimately is and how far the company is able to show that it is changing the culture from the top um and so that really is sort of going to be the kind of the test here but obviously the company felt it had to do something it was under increasing pressure not just from the financial sector but you also saw from government officials and indeed from its customers and I think that's why you've got Dave for example saying he is going to step down falling on his sword and trying to kind of address some of the criticism that has been leveled at this company yeah I I mean normally with this we do get sort of big changes as I was just chatting there with John um I mean do you sort of feel like the trick is they have to show they taking some serious action but kind of keep business carrying on as normal as best as possible not too much Tom I'll just try and steady things well look I mean I think you know what makes Boeing different from certainly other companies is is that you're talking about essentially two main players in this market Boeing is the American sort of major player here uh the European other player is Airbus essentially we're talking about a duopoly when there are only two players I think ultimately uh the customers in this case the airlines don't really have much alternative in terms of where they can turn to to try and buy their aircraft they're already facing these long delays waiting for deliveries of planes I mean who else are they going to go to where are they going to go air bus is already sort of uh pretty much at full capacity and so I think Boeing has room to get it right but what we're seeing here is the pressure on the company to say you need to go further and I think this is the attempt by management and the speed with which you're seeing the head of the commercial uh side of the company leaving immediately not waiting uh I think they're trying to send a message we are trying to write the ship but right now A once Great American company uh is certainly struggling\", metadata={'source': '7goRcrFKs3U', 'title': 'Boeing boss to leave as

record-breaking air temperatures to 10 consecutive months the average was 0.1 Celsius above the previous High set in 2016 a significant margin by global standards our climate editor Justin rout reports last week the president of Zimbabwe declared a national disaster because of a deep drought in the country low rainfall has slashed crop yields driving up food prices and putting an estimated 2.7 million people at risk of hunger it is just one example of a pattern of heat and drought affecting countries as far a field as southern Europe and Southeast Asia this graph shows how march continued the world's run of record-breaking monthly temperatures this extreme heat has got many climate scientists worried the reality is that we can quantify a large proportion of the the extra heat that's causing these records but not all of it so there needs to be a lot more science and there will be much more science coming out over the next weeks and months to try and understand what's happening to our climate system and are we in a new phase scientists agree what is causing climate change it is the vast quantities of Planet warming gases Humanity has been pumping into the atmosphere and in recent months a recurring weather event known as El Nino has been adding an extra blast of heat into the air that is weakening now so temperatures should begin to fall back later in the year the problem is sea temperatures remain extremely high hitting many of the world's coral reefs hard that suggests global temperatures might not fall back as expected a sign fear some scientists that the world could be entering a new phase of more rapid climate change Justin rollat BBC News let's get some analysis now with Dr Khloe brimham climate scientist and heat wav researcher at the University of Gratz in Austria welcome to you thanks very much for being with us um what are your thoughts your analysis on this latest report and these figures so I think that it's now not a surprise to see these temperature records being broken month on month and as uh Justin roll out was saying um we know that this is to do with um elino also adding heat into the system and so we're seeing these temperatures consecutively broken but also the extreme weather events like that in Zimbabwe that we're seeing and elsewhere in the world and what consequences do you think we're likely to see in the coming months so we're coming into the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and that's where most people live and and so we know that we're going to likely to see an increase in the number of heat waves I can't sell you exactly right now because it's too far in advance but we are likely to see heat waves increase in sort of drought conditions but also increases in things like flash flooding and wildfires basically the same as what we've seen um in past summers in recent years and so it is quite concerning that we might be entering a new climate phase yeah and we have seen a record-breaking temperatures both on land and in the sea over the past several months haven't we uh we constantly hear about a a Tipping Point where climate change accelerates and becomes Unstoppable are you fearful that we've reached that point I think that we all need to be hopeful so tipping points a two side of a coin and so we have positive social tipping points so if we all come together like we did on covid we can um basically Al it's never too early to start um slowing the tide on climate change and making things better for basically all of us we've also seen reports in the news recently of um the price of chocolate Rising because of climate change and so I think we keep seeing these reports and it's affecting Europe also growingly and we just need to act on it and we know what we need to do we know we need a transition to Net Zero we know we need to put in place support for count in the global sou for the worst impacts of climate change and so now is the time to start acting and and hopefully by month 11 of record-breaking uh temperatures we will hopefully start to see that yeah you say now is a time to start acting I mean sadly we've heard that for many years haven't we the UN holds a climate conference every year cop where countries commit to various things with regards to emissions targets do you feel that you know the world world leaders have come to grips with this they are dealing with this and if not why not what is stopping us I don't think that world leaders have come to grips with this I think there are probably standout Nations that are doing more than others um I think that it's very difficult because at cop you're trying to call for Global consensus and it's very difficult to get everybody to agree on one thing the standout environmental standard that does that is the Montreal protocol which um you know stops cfc's um and started closing the ozone hole and so if we can get the same sort of commitment um from countries and the same sort of progress we could have that same turnaround for climate change it's just getting the commitment there and putting sort of um National fiveyear agendas behind us and thinking of long-term goals and I think that's what been the challenge but also the communication and just how urgent this actually is and the realization that this is affecting societies right now and we need to act on this right now not in a 100 years Time Dr Chloe brim I'm really interesting to get your thoughts and Analysis thank you thank you\", metadata={'source': '97nEBjiQI1M', 'title': \"Climate

              " Document(page_content=\"Donald Trump has said that abortion rights expected to be a key issue in November's presidential election should be decided by individual states Mr Trump said he was responsible for the 2022 Supreme Court decision ending a federal right to the procedure adding that in his view abortion was now where everybody wanted it to be from a legal standpoint he didn't specify a gestational week at which he would ban abortion but he said he supported exceptions for rape incest and to protect the life of the mother many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended row v Wade they wanted it ended it must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even even beyond the 9th month the concept of having an abortion in the later months and even execution after birth and that's exactly what it is the baby is born the baby is executed after birth is unacceptable and almost everyone agrees with that my view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint the states will determine by Vote or legislation or perhaps both and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the state many states will be different many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others and that's what they will be at the end of the day this is all about the will of the people you must follow your heart or in many cases your religion or your faith do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself do what's right for your children do what's right right for our country and vote so important to vote at the end of the day it's all about will of the people that's where we are right now and that's what we want the will of the people well Michael Sherer National political reporter with the Washington Post gave me his reaction well he's definitely been leaning in that direction for a number of months there were a couple Kur fuff during the primary in which he said similar things about not wanting a federal Banner as campaign did about uh Republican voters needing to respect the will of the people and then he would back off of that because he was in a Republican primary this is really a political move he's got an enormous headwind and actually you know Republicans running Statewide for Senate have enormous headwind abortion has really motivated Democratic voters and he's trying to uh dampen down that issue he knows it's something that uh you know really threatens to defeat him in November and he's trying to take away the idea that as president he would push for a federal ban even though during his term as president president he did push for a 20we ban uh and and members of his party are going to continue to push for a ban and he's previously said he would work something out um this won't change what the Biden campaign's doing they're going to spend you know2 200 300 million dos on Advertising you know saying that the reason in a lot of these key swing States you no longer have the same access to abortion is uh is President Trump and row and probably surfacing some of his old comments in which he did call for basically a ban on abortion I mean at one point and he took this back he even called for um prosecution of of women who had abortions um so this doesn't take the issue off the table but he's hoping it will reduce the severity of it for himself and I know it is very early because this statement has only just come out but is it likely to you know reduce opposition from potential supporters so I I think it's a complicated question I don't think we know the answer uh you know the the there is going to be some backlash from the right from his conservative Evangelical supporters who have long supported Federal uh legislation restricting abortion he's basically ruling that out here he has previously supported Federal legislation now whether those people stay home or vote third party is is you know an open question they probably don't um I don't think this has you know it like it's a matter of degree it doesn't change completely the conversation if you look at a lot of the state stes where this presidential election is going to be decided Georgia North Carolina Michigan Wisconsin Arizona abortion is very much a live issue on the state level the only reason it's a live issue on the state level is uh that roie Wade was overturned and and president Trump is claiming credit for overturning roie Wade so it doesn't take him out of the conversation about abortion and I think uh Biden will be able to go to voters and say look the reason you're concerned that you or your daughter or your wife are going to have trouble getting abortion access uh right now is is that President Trump did this and and President Biden is running on a platform of restoring roie Wade uh on the federal level\", metadata={'source': 'bjmK4lGKNqY',

military Jun the BBC has learned that is despite the fact that ringas are denied citizenship and are subjected to a range of discriminatory restrictions including a ban on travel outside their communities well our southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan headed is in Bangkok and told me more about what he's learned well with my burmes colleagues we've spoken to um seven different people in Five camps now you have to remember that while uh millions of ringers have left rakine State 700,000 were driven out in the Dreadful attacks on them by the military back in 2017 an operation described by the UN as possible genocide another 600,000 R remain in reine state in this very precarious situation and a quarter of those are confined to these squalled um IDP camps um they've been there since communal violence 12 years ago they can't move and we spoke to these seven people in five different camps just to confirm that this systematic constriction was going on the military government has denied it they say they're just getting ringers prepared to defend their own camps this is not what we heard we heard that the military been going around and telling the camp organizers that they must provide lists of young men ready to be conscripted uh between 15 and 25 from each Camp each time they came and these men were then selected they were told they had no choice that their families would be threatened by the military if they didn't comply they was sent for training taught out of fire guns and then thrown into battle and in rakine state where the ringas are there is a huge amount of conflict at the moment between an Insurgent Army the arican Army and the military the military has been pushed back it's been defeated there as it has been in many other parts of Myanmar and it's struggling to fill its ranks it's lost a lot of troops through desertion or through injuries and so it's simply using the ringas instead and they described horrific experiences of being thrown into these brutal battle chaotic battles uh where they suffered injuries they saw other reinges killed eventually they were sent back um to home after after the battle was over but they're sitting some of them have gone into hiding because they say that we're being told we might be summoned to go back and fight again and presumably Jonathan they they have no hope of that situation changing well they're trapped you see we we we know of lots of people in Myanmar after this conscription law was enforced in the last few weeks because the military can't get people to join the Army it's so unpopular lots of people in myama are fleeing they're either coming here to Thailand or they're going underground but these reinges are stuck in these camps they're never allowed to move anyway they're completely trapped and they're very easy for the military to go and just point a finger and say you've got to join but think of the Hideous irony here the military in particular uh does not recognize the reinges as having any legal right to live in Myanmar they've pursued these Dreadful policies against some of discrimination and outright um killings in back in 2017 they've always been regarded Ed almost as sort of UNP as people who just don't belong and yet now they're being forced to fight the military's battles and it has another bad knock on consequence because the local rakine Buddhist population the other community in rakine supports the insurgence and it's only going to inflame tensions between them and the reinges when the reinges are seen unwillingly of course fighting on the military side

has been speaking to the BBC Christina Balon says she's still seeking a public apology for how she was treated after raising safety concerns about Tesla vehicles until 2014 Miss Balon was a rising star at the car maker in the US she spoke to our technology editor Zoe Kleinman I was the only woman in the team like engineering them and uh in the beginning was great in the early days Christina Balon was doing so well at Tesla her initials were engraved on the car's batteries but she says it wasn't long before things took a turn for the worse everything went South when I realized that they were hiding some critical safety issues she claims they pretended that they didn't know and you decided to go right to the top you went to Elon Musk himself I tried to and what exactly was the safety concern they realized that they make a design and gening mistake on the carpets you know that every the carpet that you have under the paddles and in the front of the car so what happened it's those carpets they were curling under the break and under the acceleration Christina further claims that she'd heard there were complaints made about this issue so believes Tesla was aware of it she claims that when she shared her worries Tesla's management turned hostile she lost her job sued the firm and won but then Tesla did something unexpected they dare to accuse me of serious crimes like in basment they just purely invented those with one scope in mind to give a lesson to everybody who there to speak up Tesla said in a public statement that Christina had used company resources for a secret project she denies this and the firm has never provided proof what do you want to get out of this now this this long running battle with this company I want to clear my name I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologize I battling the most aggressive type of breast cancer and uh Elon Musk and their lawyers knows that and they were willing to allow a little boy who I'm his hero for him you know I'm the mommy who does their planes and cars to let my memory of me for him be Shadow forever that her his mom sto from Tesla and I want to do something for all the cancer patients out there and especially breast cancer patient oh you're setting me off my goodness BBC News put her claims to Tesla but the firm has not responded on its website Tesla says safety is the most important part of every Tesla we design our vehicles to exceed safety standards T would have done the right thing for so many time for so many years and they did it'll now be up to the California courts to decide the next chapter for Christina who's currently in remission from her cancer but there's no court date set yet zo Kleinman BBC News\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n

biggest cause of preventable death in the UK it kills 2third of long-term users the aim of the new bill before Parliament is to protect younger Generations from harm by Banning tobacco use for them one caller with experience of that harm told the Nikki Campbell show on BBC Radio 5 live he regretted ever starting to smoke I have to have one lung removed got empia and COPD Neal lung and now I found out got terminal cancer in me Li and adrenal glands back I yeah it's some I've got used to now I've come to terms with it but what I've gone through the last three years I wouldn't like anybody to go through you know and ever could go back I wish I never started the harm done by smoking is well documented it causes lung and heart disease cancers still births dementia and Asthma England's chief medical officer sir Chris witty supports the ban people are trapped in smoking at a very young age uh and once they become addicted their choice is taken away so if you're in favor of choice you should be against something which takes away people's choices the majority great majority smokers wished they'd never started but now they're in trouble the tobacco and Vapes Bill set before Parliament today represents a huge step change it proposes that anyone turning 15 this year and all younger Generations would be banned from buying cigarettes throughout their lives but it sparked a fierce debate about freedoms what this policy does it infantilizes future adults because when you are 18 in this country you are legally an adult and as such you should be treated like one now look at 18 you can drive a car you can join the Army you can possess a credit card you can buy alcohol and most importantly you can vote the bill also includes new restrictions to tackle concerns about the sharp rise in children using Vapes it would ensure flavors and packaging were less appealing to children but some are doubtful it will work I don't think anybody necessarily looks at the packaging and be oh let's just try that it's more that oh it's vaping it's like a cool thing to do just as smoking was in the 80s kids will be kids they will try smoking they'll try vaping the debate continues in Parliament today with where MPS will be given their first chance to vote on what would be the world's first lifelong smoking ban for younger Generations Sophie Hutchinson BBC News while that debate is continuing in the Commons and health secretary Victoria Atkins has been explaining why she wants the law to be changed we are trying to move away from this idea that um uh teenagers Uh current youngsters uh will be able to buy their cigarettes Le legally in shops uh from the age of 18 in 2027 precisely because we want to ensure that they can lead uh longer healthier lives Victoria Atkins

amongst those who addressed the national conservative event were two British politicians Nigel farage and sella bravman the organizers who were rejected by two other planned venues after a series of protests have said they'll seek legal advice miss braan a former UK Home Secretary left the conference after giving her speech she didn't stop to speak to reporters before getting in her car the local mayor had expressed concerns about Public Safety our Europe correspondent Nick beak is just in front of the venue here's what's been happening there the picture here tells the story because you can see there was this line of police officers probably about a dozen or so of them and the reason for that is that the local mayor here in Brussels has said that this event needs to be shut down so as you can see the police aren't exactly running in to Turf people out but basically the organizers of this event of this conference have been told that it has to wind down so basically in effect what's happening is that people aren't being allowed in and those leaving at the moment including Nigel farage and so and these prominent uh UK politicians they've left but they won't be allowed in along with anyone else and Nigel farage of course a lot of people will know for his role here in this city during the brexit days a leading campaigner for brexit said that this was bad decision what was happening here he said this was an attempt to stifle free speech now I put it to him what the local mayor had said in this letter that was presented to the um to the organizers here that there were potentially homophobes and people with views on other subjects including abortion on stage and in the audience and he said that was cobblers he didn't think that was the case whatsoever and he made his exits if you look through this is where the main event is and you can see possibly someone on stage there and so there are a few speeches still getting underway people have had some some food and light refreshment so this is continuing despite the efforts of the local authorities and the police to close it down so I mean what is definitely not happening is that you've got loads of police officers running in pulling people out but the the idea is that this will you know come to a halt I think it might be that for another couple of hours or so we're in this limbo the big the big question is what happens tomorrow because you've got Victor Orban the the leader of Hungary who's supposed to be among the keynote speakers to tomorrow will this be allowed to to happen tomorrow will people be allowed in the venue so yeah that's what's happening at the moment and I should say you know sort of the whole idea of this event has been overshadowed somewhat by what's been happening this was the third venue That was supposed to host it after the previous two venues uh their their hosting basically fell through the idea is that a number of politicians on the right and center right and particularly the far right across Europe are here exchanging ideas ahead of the the European elections uh in June Nick be there\"],\n [{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n

East where Israel appears to be trying to gather international support following the Iranian air strikes but has not so far at least carried out any direct military action in response instead Israel is calling for more sanctions on Iran which itself has warned Israel against attempting any retaliation following those drone and missile attacks which Iran says were a response to an Israeli attack on its diplomatic mission in Syria Chief International correspondent Lee duet has been sending us updates from Jerusalem Israel says it is now launching a diplomatic offensive the Israeli foreign minister has written he says to 32 countries around the world urging them to impose even more sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran the foreign minister Israel Katz posted this on X formerly Twitter saying Israel that Iran has to be stopped now for it is too late and that is the message that's also being sounded by Leading senior military officials here in Israel including the chief of staff leftenant General hery halvi he said that Israel would have to respond he made the comments by visiting the Neva team Airbase in southern Israel where some of Iran's missiles did actually hit in the early hours of Sunday morning although Israel says there was limited damage Israel says only a handful of missiles actually got through of the 350 suicide drones and Cru and ballistic missiles which were fired by Iran Iran says its retaliatory strike was in response to Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound in the Syrian Capital Damascus on April the 1st Iran's foreign minister Amir abdan has reiterated that message in a telephone conversation with the un Secretary General Antonio gues saying that Iran acted in legitimate self-defense Iran too is calling for restraint saying it doesn't want this to escalate into a wider War we're going to look at the Peril in this moment but just to remind you that this tension takes place in the midst of the ongoing Israel Gaza War it's the 193rd day of war and today there are reports fighting in the Gaza Strip and most particularly in bet hanon in the Northeast there are also reports that more Aid is now getting into Gaza from the north we're getting reports on the ground and that is what Israel is saying that news is being greeted with relief for many many weeks now a agencies have been warning that more than half of the population of Gaza is facing acute hunger well let's now cross to the Qatari Capital Doha to join Miranda kamrava who is the director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for research and policy studies welcome to BBC news thank you leas good to be here of course you are following every uh Twist and Turn of this escalating crisis between Israel and Iran how would you describe this particular moment well the Israelis crossed the red line by attacking Iran's diplomatic compound in Damascus and then the Iranians crossed uh another red line uh by attacking Israeli soil and so we're at a very uh precarious in fact dangerous moment where we're likely to see an Israeli retaliatory strike for Iran's retaliatory strike and so the Vicious Cycle is likely to continue unfortunately this moment seems to underline the the dangerous differences in perception Iran is saying this was a very limited a very calibrated a strike it caused limited casual limited damage for Israel of course it was a reckless strike which breached its security and must there must be a retaliation and that is what is going to fuel this conflict is it not absolutely and in fact uh I think uh we do see that the Iranians did hold back they had to somehow retaliate for the attack on their uh Embassy compound and so as far as they're concerned deterrence has been reestablished and now they're saying that if Israel attacks Iran again or Iranian interests or Personnel uh there will be more of this kind kind of retaliatory strike of course netanyahu's political predicament inside Israel don't allow for restraint and we've seen Netanyahu have a penchant for overreaction he's also under pressure from the right flank of his own cabinet and so unfortunately as you mentioned we're at a precarious and very dangerous moment indeed and the speculation now seems to be that even though there are disagreements within the War cabinet and we are hearing that the cabinet may meet again today some of the former U military generals saying we should we should we should retaliate now others saying let's build our International and our regional Coalition first because they are emphasizing that this Coalition the support Israel is receiving at this moment that matters too absolutely and uh also crucial is the support that the United States will give to is Israel both diplomatically and uh militarily and we've uh heard very loud and clear messages coming out of Washington that is that the United States would not assist Israel on an attack uh uh on Iranian soil and so I think that's also given some pause to Israeli military commanders do they really want to go it alone uh knowing that Iran has this so-called axis of resistance that it can activate when it feels very threatened Marin comad thank you very much it's always good to hear your perspective no doubt we'll hear from you again as this crisis continues to unfold and as I mentioned uh during that uh discussion that we are hearing reports that the war cabinet will meet again today this will be its third meeting since uh that unprecedented attack in the early hours of Sunday morning what is absolutely clear is that uh Israel has decided it will respond but will it retaliate by attacking Iran directly that would also be unprecedented after Decades of a shadow war and covert operations will it attack some of U Iran's proxies and Lebanon Iraq Syria uh or even indeed in Yemen or will they wait and build a coalition these these are questions which matter and they matter to the Future stability at this region in the midst of what is already a very very volatile time as our world affairs correspondent at least you set there with the latest lines uh from the Middle East\"],\n [{\n            'v': 4,\n

Greece and to Olympia where the flame lighting ceremony is taking place let's have a listen in as we expect that flame to be lit in the next 5 minutes or so statues in the ancient times we'll be seeing these coroy later on waiting for us the temple we have the priestesses featuring The high priestess as well the artistic director of The Flame lighting ceremon and the choreographer emis ignu who will in a few moments time formally there she is when she strike the drum that will formally begin the torch lighting ceremony the distinguished guests LED of course by the uh [Music] this is always a very magical moment the official Olympic flame lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia of course the uh flame was lit throughout the duration of the games and that is the continuity that we're seeing in the modern era as well once this flame is lit it will not be extinguished until the closing ceremony so that the scene live in Olympia where the sacred flame for the Paris 2024 Olympics is to be lit in of course the ancient birthplace of the games there will then be the torch relay which will spread from the Acropolis to the South Pacific and as you can see hundreds of dignitaries and Spectators are there in Southwest Greece where the modern day Olympics were born in where the ceremony is held every two years for both the summer and the Winter Olympics now you can see there uh there is the Greek actress Mary Mina now she is we think going to help bring the Olympic flame to life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror beforehand it to the first torch Bearer so there is a parabolic mirror that you can see there in the middle of your shot um which we think is actually what is going to be H used to help light the flame it will then be passed to the first torch Bearer who is a Olympic rowing Champion um and then it will be handed on as it goes on the torch relay now the ceremony here in Olympia been conducted in the ruins of the 2,600 year old Temple of Hera uh as we saw in the pictures the Greek president is there as is the international Olympic Committee president Thomas back who we heard uh talking a little earlier the torch itself harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the games the tradition was revived in 19 36 for the Berlin games now uh there will be an 11 day relay of the torch on Greek soil some 600 torch bearers will carry the flame over a distance of 5,000 kilm through 41 different municipalities and areas of Greece before it is then given over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will happen um in uh April um in the late 26th is when the actual flame gets handed over to Paris so what we're seeing at the moment is this ceremony um where we expect that uh the polished parabolic mirror will be used that you can see there in the shot to help light the flame let's have a listen in for for so if you have just joined us on BBC News news we are watching live from Olympia in Greece the sacred flame lighting ceremony for the Paris 2024 Olympics it of course happens in Olympia which is the birthplace of the ancient games before that uh torch relay takes place from the Acropolis to the South Pacific there you can see the flame being walked in to the ancient 2000 600-year-old Temple of Hera uh in Greece the Greek president the international Olympic Committee president amongst the dignitaries there as of course are the officials from the Paris 2024 Games the actual Olympics will start on the 26th of July in Paris 19 days of competition but of course before that gets underway there is always the torch relay and and it starts from Greece uh where that flame will make its move during an 11 day relay in Greece itself around 600 torch bearers will carry that flame over 5,000 km through 41 municipalities before it is then handed over to the Paris 2024 organizers that will have a special ceremony as well at the site of the first modern Olympics of 1896 uh that will happen on April the 26th then of course the across France there's going to be 10,000 torch bearers that will carry the fame across 64 different French territories uh there'll be 400 towns dozens of attractions during its 12,000 km Journey both through Mainland France and also uh the overseas French territories in the Caribbean Indian Ocean and Pacific so there we see the flame being put down um ready for the ceremony for the torch to be lit in ancient Olympia for Vil [Music] [Music] the harini so for so that is Greek actress Mary Mina who is the high priestess who is now holding that Olympic torch as she moves down to light from the flame the first torch of the [Applause] relay so there we have the Olympic flame has been lit in Olympia in Greece ahead of the Paris Summer Olympics as I say the Greek actress Mary Mina now holding that Olympic flame she is the high Priestess in this ceremony and now lighting it another flame that will burn there of course there are always backup Flames whenever the torch relay happens just in case the torch does go out there is always a backup flame that it can be relit from so that once that flame is lit it will continue throughout the journey that it will take first traveling through Greece before crossing the Mediterranean to France that's going to happen in May on a three masted ship it will then travel through France and its overseas territories before arriving in Paris for the start of the games in July that ceremony is continuing in Olympia and you can continue to watch that on our BBC News website and app we have a special live feed from the ceremony if you do want to go and continue watching that flame lighting ceremony from Olympia\"],\n [{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-11 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth at some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence so we're going to start with futurism which reports that uh the humans behind the accounts of virtual influences or AI generated characters that masquerade is the real thing on social media media are now pasting fake faces onto the bodies of Real Models meanwhile Business Insider asks whether AI will put an end to gen Z's obsession with becoming an influencer after Major Brands begin to show interest in using AI models instead of humans Mashable says a misc captioned video falsely claiming to be an Iranian missile strike on Tel Aviv was promoted as legitimate by social media platform X fake headline quote Iran strikes Tel Aviv with heavy missiles was apparently generated by X's own official AI chatbot The Verge looks at Ai and copyright in the US a new bill could force uh tech companies to disclose any copyrighted materials they use to train their AI models the bill from representative uh Adam shift would require anyone making a training data set for AI to to submit reports on its contents to the copyrights register there's been a pet hate of teachers everywhere but not in Texas where they plan to replace thousands of human exam markers with artificial intelligence it's believed the AI graded tests could save $20 million a year that's from Tech spot and finally popular science uh future AI developer Google deepmind who are now able to train tiny off-the-shelf robots to play soccer uh we'll show you a bit of that later with me is priia Lani who's CEO of century Tech and artificial intelligence education technology company that develops AI powered learning tools thanks very much for coming on the program good to see you great to see you okay we're going to start now with this AI influences so artificial influence we we can take a look at um a little bit of what we are talking about so those AI influen are deep faking fake faces onto real women's bodies without permission and the the subheading there is it's a real problem is that is that how you see it yeah absolutely so the first story is about these people that are taking the real bodies of women mostly and then they're putting on a deep fake face right and then they're posting that and earning money actually from it most of the time on competitive of only fans which is a platform where essentially creators can put on their own content now in the context of only fans um more creators on only fans are women rather than men um 85% of the top 10% of earners are women and an average Creator Le just to give you a bit of context right earns about $180 a month so this is a business for some of these creators where they're you know using their own images their own bodies and creating that content and so essentially their content and their videos are being ripped off right because then you superimpose an AI face and post it elsewhere and you make money off that content so firstly you're violating personal rights yes but the second thing you're doing is obviously infringing on the the woman the creators intellectual property um and 300 people I think 300 odd odd creators have surpassed a million dollars annually earning money from from doing this so they have a very good right to be very very upset about this so it is a real problem and just just so you you get it personally this took me six 60 seconds to do actually if we can put it up on on the screen so I created one of you but actually so because there are so many tools that allow us to do this so This literally took me less than a minute actually I've done the reverse here I've got your face but I've actually changed your body yeah right you look great casual Lewis but but and so that's a bit of fern but can we have a look at it in this context so I just created this before I got here so I didn't have time to send it to the producers but if you look at my iPad leis so I took a video of you okay on BC just lift Okay so we've got you on the BBC presenting okay um a story about Tik Tok so hopefully the viewers can see that I apologize this is really last minute yeah and then uh through magic hour AI I've mashed your face with Christians Christian phrases oh my that is a terrifying thought in every way right but you see how this is you in your day job right so I've got your body I've got your I've got the BBC thankfully it stopped it stopped right so you and Christian together that's what you guys would look like um but what's interesting about that I think your your floor manager is laughing no one can hear that right now um the reason that's really important to show is that that is you in your day job and so creators are obviously creating this content you know which we we've shown um viewers and they're earning money from it so not only is it a personal affront but it's also a professional affront well and how do you you just knock knocked that up pretty quickly and pretty disturbing that's in the cab on the way here and and so how do you how do you begin to try and stop that how if it's so easy how do you how can you try and stop well and I think some of the some of the stories that we're going to come on to will help with this but obviously the input here is a an infringement right it's an infringement of Ip rights so there are laws um to protect uh copyright and we're going to talk about that in a minute in a future story but what's really important is when we're talking about this sort of generative AI okay separate it into two areas separate it into the input this is really important for the rest of how regulation and law develops in this area separate AI into the training data what was the input what data was used to train the artificial intelligence models yes and then the output what came out of the other side right now actually in the cases in the story The reason why it's just so blatant is because the output is also substantially similar right to the input okay so how do you do that well there are laws to protect in these areas is but what I find and find really really difficult is the fact that law is sometimes so expensive and difficult to access for some people so it's not actually as as Fair as saying well you know you've got recourse okay let's look at this is very very linked as you were talking Business Insider Jen's fading dream human influences are being replaced by artificial intelligence and maybe that's a good thing yeah well so so apparently a lot of gen Zed and I got anywhere from half of genz to a quarter of gened that's a lot of gen Zed want to be influencers that's the future career aspiration of of of these young people about 25% of marketers work with influencers and and again it's a job for them right so when it comes to influencers they earn a lot of money um they they create content they partner with brands for example and Brands find this really great because the return on investment from an influencer promoting your content is higher on average than if you just advertise your content so a brand would earn an average of about just over $5 in Media value for every $1 spent on an influencer so it's a huge Market but the reason why this article is basically saying your hopes and dreams no longer going to be alive right genz said is because people are using AI influencers these are completely fictitious which is what we're seeing right now so this woman here is not a real woman that's AI on top no that's AI absolutely that's yeah exactly so they're using AI to actually you know and and why right because it's cheaper right so if I can do that in a few minutes right if you're doing it where you're not substantially copying this is a different story right this is not about copying on on real pp's bodies but if you can create truly original con original output content I should say otherwise every Tech is going to have a goat me saying hang on what was the input okay but you can do that cheaper Brands can do that cheaper you don't have to pay people money you could run many characters on platforms yourself you don't have to deal with any egos that would be pretty cool right the video to me the presenter ego absolutely talking and and and so therefore this is a potential solution to that issue but I tell you what could happen right which is really interesting if you end up with AIS right out there influencing and partnering with Brands right the the most the area that most uses influences is lifestyle and second is beauty right the point is is that you trust influencers that's why they work are you going to trust an AI putting cream on their face saying my visible in my 40s lines have disappeared so actually that authenticity of the human I think will become even more valuable in the future so therefore therefore still Del a potential career path right we're going to move on to Mashable we're going to whip through a couple of these stories now Elon musk's X pushed a fake headline about Iran attacking Israel uh talk us through this because this is potential real world warning signal yeah and this is what actually people have been talking about for so long so the fact that we're just seeing it play out is actually really really sad um for for the people that have been in this space for years talking about this so essentially all that happened was that um there was content onx right that was fake news right the fact that it stated that Iran was responsible for these strikes actually that's the footage was from Ukraine I think uh launching strikes against Russians in Crimea um but anyway it was it was fake news and then grock which is uh Elon musk's big investment in generative AI um that operates on the X platform took essentially this content saw it as a trending topic made up this is an AI right made up its own headline made up its own contextualized story all fake news and then actually posted that to X users and and the problem with this obviously is it's dangerous and it reminds you of that 1938 a and Wells story where War of the Worlds right where he was on the radio and he was actually talking about martians and Aliens descending on Earth people tuned in a bit late and there was mass hysteria apparently people left their homes so how you can have an influence by posting fake news is real this is really dangerous and disinformation in fake news has to be tackled and we need to hurry up right in terms of Regulation and I mean you know ex ex is already in trouble with the EU at the moment and I think it's only a matter of time really you know for for other states to take action as well okay we're going to have a look at legislation attempts anyway The Verge a new Bill wants to reveal what's really inside AI training data so what's the attempt here yeah okay so this is very much linked to all of this right so the input data so what's happened here is Adam Schiff who is um I believe a you're going to correct me a Democrat sen Senator have I got that right but he's proposed a bill to the House of Representatives where essentially any generative AI platforms would have to list if the bill was passed so post Bill not not the current platforms with their current training data just to be clear um any copyright sources copyrighted sources that they've used to train their data models which actually gives you that transparency of what's been used right the EU already have this um in their in their drafts uh for the EU um AI act so so essentially it would it would it would put you on this Level Playing Field with the EU and the UK is saying that people in the UK saying we should hurry up as well and so it gives you that transparency of what has been the input content so when there are cases there are plenty of lawsuits at the moment for example John Grisham and a bunch of authors the New York Times has taken open AI to court it would give content creators and copyright holders the ability to to essentially check if their content has been used and if copyright has been infringed I see but it's not law yet so we keep an eye on it see how it see how it develops it's moving quickly okay uh we're going to stay in the US Texas is replacing thousands of human exam scorers with AI this is from Tech spot uh how is this going to work this is really interesting right so it does cost millions and millions of pounds in the UK dollars in the US all over the world to Mark exam scripts so they've changed the exam in Texas so that it has more long form answers so less multiple choice exact short answer and they're going to be using trained AI models to Mark students answers now before you look really skeptical okay what I would say is if you look at gcses in the UK in England for example if you look at the GCSE papers and long form answers for example in a history essay right actually it's pretty proven that marking can be a bit skew whiffing cases because you have the human marking and it can be sometimes quite subjective even if you have a rubric and a mark scheme and we've actually developed this sort of Technology at Cent as well when it comes to literacy what you do is you train your own proprietary models you don't just plug it into a GPT why because when a third party upgrades its own models actually you don't know what changes have been made and then you can see a prompt that you enter today could actually give you a completely different answer next time and then you use the exam scripts you look at the you essentially constantly have this human evaluation which is what Texas will do they've trained it on 3,000 transcripts they'll mark Mark and save lots of money and apparently need to use 2,000 people rather than 6,000 people this year but it actually is an ongoing investment because every time an exam takes place you take lots of scripts you look at the scripts where there was a low probability of those scripts being marked properly you retrain your models and it's an ongoing process very quickly that seems to make sense and I can't imagine marking script after script if you're a human teacher or exam is the most fun so that's po I bet some of them find it really fun actually I'm Jud it's an we have 30 seconds left do you want to watch some cute little robots playing football of course you do let's take a look at that right just in 20 seconds priia what's going on so essentially Deep Mind have built these mini robots playing football they use what's called Deep reinforcements learning it's a really really powerful technique in artificial intelligence where you look at all the permutations of how a football uh play might take place you reward the system or you punish it if it doesn't for example score a goal and then they're basically through Brute Force training it with tons and tons of data using deep learning as well so the technique is super interesting and here you go will will one of those be lifesized and play for Man United and help my team I don't know hopefully oh he's falling over again it is adorable when they fall over right priia amazing thank you so much we're are out of time thank you thanks Lou\"],\n [{\n            'v': 6,\n            'f': \"6\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-04 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

magnitude 7.4 earthquake there at least nine people were killed more than 1,000 others injured in the strongest Quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years more than 100 people are understood to be trapped in collapsed tunnels along the coastline and around 30 buildings are reported to have collapsed altogether our correspondent Shima Khalil reports on taiwan's East Coast the rescue operation continues in the most challenging of circumstances teams are searching for those still trapped but so much is in the way the huge destruction and the dozens of Tremors that followed I'm afraid of aftershocks and I don't know how bad the shaking will be and then the house is already a mess how do you get in there's no way to get in inan the worst hit City some people spent the night outdoors as the aftershocks continued this is the moment the earthquake hit as residents were getting ready to start their day the earthquake woke me up and we just stayed around here across from the night market it's terrible this earthquake is huge homes and businesses buckled leaving whole floors underground this partially collapsed building now left tilted and unstable threatens more damage with the continu Tremors but in taiwan's rugged mountainous East Coast it was the landslides that unleashed the most Terror the earthquake caused hundreds of them bringing huge rocks tumbling down valleys destroying roads and railway lines and blocking access to the area this beautiful landscape turned into a scene of horror and for those still trapped in collapsed tunnels and Roads that horror is not over yet shy Mahalo BBC News Tokyo let's speak to Nar Farm filmmaker who is in Taipei Nar it's good to have you with us again now since we last spoke uh what is the mood there and particularly now that there's still this rescue operation going on is that getting in the way of of feeling like there's some closure there and and the ability to move on yes um I think the people here feel quite anxious about um the rescue operation that is going on in h and um now if you know Taiwan uh it rains a lot in Taiwan and poan is not exception so today um I think that people expect a light rain there and with the terrain in palian is is going to be very difficult for rescue workers to get into the area that people are trapped um in the r um and also in mountainous areas is is also with Fallen rocks there's another danger for people to access the area um to put themselves in that risk of being squashed by by the Rocks as well uh so um people in Tai um I think feel a great Sympathy for the people in Juan they also um want the government to accelerate the effort to look for the people who are still missing uh besides that I think the life in taipe has returned to normal uh working around the city you'll see that nothing changed you know people uh don't talk much about the earthquake um they've been very resilient for many reasons and they say so uh in face of this disaster yeah that's that's really interesting you did say that yesterday that you were really struck by the resilience of the people around you clearly that's still the case uh as the aftermath becomes clearer uh they are saying that this is the worst quake in 25 years is that registering in in people's minds definitely people of older Generations all uh yesterday all talked about how they witnessed the earthquake back in 1999 um I met a man I spoke to a man who actually was in taum when the earth earthquake happened uh back then and he said that it was a huge shock um compared to it he said nothing really happened yesterday he said that you know people in Taiwan are have you know have great experience dealing with such disaster and that's that's why they feel in karma and also um there's been training there's been uh efforts by the authorities to fortify bu buildings here and create a very effective procedure to deal with disasters such as earthquake so luckily um it was uh there was no major damages to the city uh compared to the last time let's go to hen where our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes uh is there to speak to us and of course it's a City close to the Quakes epicenter Rupert uh it's good to have you on now we talked about those rescue efforts earlier in the program could you tell us uh what more we know about them yeah I can I mean here in the middle of qu and you can see what's going on behind me here they're Shoring up this building that was partially brought down by the Quake yesterday very sadly someone died inside that building uh because of the Quake they were trapped inside there yesterday here in Juan the search and rescue operation has really uh come to an end everybody's accounted for nine people are dead they're now securing the buildings and beginning the cleanup and it's been remarkable to see how quickly this city is getting back to business but outside the city uh there is a a huge search and rescue operation going on in the mountains and we've got some new figures just in the last hour the authorities are now saying 42 people missing but the number of people trapped up there in The Valleys not far away from here has left from around 100 to they're now saying over 600 646 people now confirmed as trapped probably that's because they've been able to contact people as the cell phone network has come back to life and they're calling people and finding they're trapped in hotels uh and in villages up in the mountains but that is a huge leap in the number of people trapped and a huge issue to try and get to them and make sure they're okay yeah that's a really high figure we were actually just speaking to someone in Taipei who was telling us that people are watching and following this uh what are the conversations you've been having there uh on day two of all of this well I think it's really the sense of shock still many people espe if you're under 30 years old you've never experienced anything like this before because the last time they had a big earthquake like this in Taiwan was back in 1999 so you know when you see pictures you may have seen uh you know people talking uh on TV saying I was really scared I didn't know what to do it was absolutely terrifying I think that's you know that's a very very normal reaction because a people are not used to an earthquake of this size and even in taipe yesterday it was really really a big shake and the second thing is however much Taiwan is in an earthquake zone that people say they're used to earthquakes when a big one like this hits it is absolutely terrifying and traumatizing for everybody who experiences it right riet thank you for that and of course we'll have more updates for you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 7,\n            'f': \"7\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-03

constitutional court has rejected a bid to overturn a controversial anti-gay law that is considered one of the toughest in the world the law imposes life imprisonment for consensual same-sex relationships and includes the death penalty for what it describes as aggravated homosexuality well let's go live to Nairobi and speak to our Africa reporter Esther agola Esther just bring us up today as what has happened today um uh good afternoon um so so today the Constitutional Court had its uh sittings uh just over an hour ago um and the conclusion they had was that uh as this was a matter of huge public interest um that they will not overturn the anti-homosexuality act of 2023 they did however note that the ACT did violate the uh medical rights the health rights of the LGBT plus Community um and noted that it was important um to see how to you know work that out so basically the law still stands in Uganda as per the Constitutional court today and it was rights groups that took this action to the court yes it was um and this was taken to court uh last year um and basically they were saying that it contravenes uh the human rights laws of the lgbtq plus community in Uganda to exercise um their various rights to exist to you know assemble to basically just leave their lives and we're hoping that the Constitutional Court um would overturn that but uh as it seems today um that that will not happen however the petitioners have said that they will take the matter to the Supreme Court and they are hoping that it will be overturned in its entirety yes an overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted for it what are some of the punishments for being gay in Uganda well so one of the punishments is that one can get up to life imprisonment um basically for homosexual acts um and then there's also um up to 10 years up to 14 years imprisonment for what they're calling aggravated homosexual acts um which involves rape or minors vulnerable groups um spreading of HIV and AIDS now at the time it caused quite a global outrage and indeed the US imposed visa restrictions on some officials there in Uganda has that had any effect on other lawmakers and what they feel about this um well so far uh because they say that the public sentiment um is that the law upholds the cultural rights and the cultural beliefs of the Ugandan people there's still strong support for the law to remain in place um however activists um and human rights bodies um are still calling for it to be overturn and there been there's been a lot of dismay a lot of them have called today reallying um heartbreaking homophobic and Ill informed um so moving forward it's basically just to see how the Supreme Court will listen to this cour to this case um and what are some of the issues that will emerge that the petitioners are saying um are very crucial in basically the lgbtq plus Community existing in Uganda because many have reported being attacked many have reported living in fear um as you know there's also um you know the the ACT also calls for people to report people um who are LGBT plus uh it involves renting premises it involves um registering of lgbtq plus bodies and NOS as well okay Esther AGA Africa reporter live in iobi thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 8,\n            'f': \"8\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-11 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"US President Joe Biden vows

in the Middle East President Biden has promised Israel Ironclad United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 9,\n

just a few hours ago he met US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin here talks focused on well the two major conflicts bringing stability to the Middle East and the war in Ukraine now Republican lawmakers have been holding up a proposed 60 billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine for months Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson has n let the Ukraine Aid issue be debated in the House of Representatives as yet now Lord Cameron said it wasn't for foreign politicians to tell uh lawmakers In Another Country what to do but he urged Congress to see the funding released I think it is absolutely interests of US security uh that Putin fails in his illegal Invasion I think it's good for us jobs uh that we continue to back uh Ukraine with the weapons that they need and I think in terms of how the United States the United Kingdom as allies are seen around the world um there will be people in Teran in pongyang in Beijing looking at how we stand by our allies how we help them how we stop this uh illegal and unprovoked aggression and working out whether we are committed whether we're prepared to see it through and Mr blinkin said they' also talked about ways to prevent the transfer of weapons to Russia particularly from China and North Korea this is an ongoing challenge uh and we see um weapons U we also see Technologies to support the defense industrial base in uh Russia coming from North Korea from Iran from China this is an area of particular concern for not only the United States and the United Kingdom but many of our allies and partners throughout Europe let's speak now to our state department correspondent Tom baitman hi Tom so what should we take away from that pressure conference well the most significant bit of news was an answer to M that Lord Cameron gave to a question I asked him in the Press briefing there which was about the growing pressure on the UK government to Halt armed sales to Israel around the issue of whether or not Israel had been deemed by the UK to be in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza now um Lord Cameron had said on the 8th of March that he would receive legal advice within days about that issue but here we are a month later and there had still been no announcement so I asked him that question what um did the UK government deem um Israel to have done when it came to International humanitarian law and he confirmed in his answer that the UK would continue to supply weapons to Israel and therefore that a review had taken place and my understanding is these are fairly broad not just legal reviews but also policy-based reviews and under that uh the UK would continue to um uh sell uh what is around a 35 million pound a year uh trade in weapons to the Israelis but he also said that they continue to have concerns about the issue and they would continue to review it um so that was there too but that was a significant uh moment in that news briefing there okay Tom thank you very much for that going to take a look now at the issue of ukra ukine we can speak to a global Affairs analyst and Senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Michael bosu who's in Odessa in Ukraine thank you very much for coming on the program my pleasure good to be with you so let's talk about this issue of politicians going from one country to another saying well we can't tell you what to do but you really ought to do this basically Lord Cameron today in Washington urging well expressing his support for Ukraine and urging the us to do the same how do you find that balance that diplomatic balance well it was very entertaining I think Lord Cameron was being very tight lipped about his trip to Florida but I am quite sure I would bet money on it that he told Mr Trump exactly what's going to happen if that 60 billion dollar in Aid which is being blocked by his mother Republicans will not reach Ukraine and I noticed that both um ministers made the point that a lot of this money that is your mark for Ukraine is not going to be loaded on to pallets and you know airlifted to Ukraine it's actually going to stay in the United States and create jobs that's a message that the American public needs to hear but um the other quick thing that came out is I noticed uh Lord Cameron was almost ahead of his count us counterpart Mr blink in terms of his conviction in terms of his passion in terms of the arguments made for Aid to Ukraine it's almost as if the Americans were a bit hedgy about it but Lord Cameron really his message really came through that if this war is not stopped if this Aid is not delivered Putin will go further and it will become a lot more cost C for everybody and the potential hesitancy yes there's diplomatic politics at play there's Party politics at play is it simple geography as well country is far away seen as a far away problem oh yeah absolutely uh the message I got out of today more clearly than ever is that it it is now the United Kingdom and Europe that are going to take the lead on the so-called ukra file in terms of helping Ukraine for example booler their domestic production of ammunition but um the other thing that came through is I think Lord Cameron rightly tiptoed through everything because it is a very complicated Diplomat sorry political scene in the United States right now where the man who has basic control over this vote speaker Johnson I think he does support Ukraine I think he does have the votes to make that bill pass I think he knows that uh the US public support this but he's prioritizing his own political future over everything else that he wants to remain important in that Trump wing of the Republican party and what's going to happen there if he continues along this path I think people will see him as a man who could not summon the DI the political courage to do the right thing and hence this war will continue to go on for a lot longer than it has to and what do you think the implications would be for Ukraine if Trump won the presidency well absolutely horrible he views himself as the master of the art of the deal he will try to bring it to resolution in 24 hours uh leaked reports from closed door conversations he's had indicate what most of us believe is that he'll give into territorial concessions Crimea will remain in Russian hands uh the donbas other areas that Russia has seized including that crucial land bridge between the Russian Mainland and um and the western part of Ukraine and uh he'll probably um give the signals to Mr Putin that he can go even further I mean there's a lot of nervousness I have to tell you right here in Odessa we've had alarms air rate alarms uh most of the day and night and missiles coming this way it's it's not going the right way whatsoever well I just want to just very briefly just expand on exactly that because I wanted to highlight that that is exactly where you are and ask a bit about what life is like and how it is going right now a couple of things I mean I'm very close to to the port and these strikes tend to uh Target electrical infrastructure if there's no power there's no Port uh at working and there's no grain going to World Markets uh the other thing on the other side of the country in khu it's really hell on Earth um being bombed relentlessly it does look like the Russians are on an L campaign to turn it into a a piece of rubble of gry Zone and possibly even encircle it uh so very very bad news coming out of hard tonight as well Michael bosu we really appreciate your time thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 10,\n            'f': \"10\",\n

live to Alexa kareno who's a member of Ukraine's Parliament joins us live from adessa uh thank you so much for being here on the program your reaction to this now becoming law first of all uh hello and this law was uh voted in the parliament uh almost 11 months ago finally it is signed uh yes Ukraine needs mobilization it's clear but at the same time Ukraine also needs demobilization because some people who are fighting for the third year already and they are civilians in their previous life they can't fight forever and very important issue is the determining of term of service or Ukrainian soldiers and those who want to be changed after for example two years of fighting uh they should be changed yes so this is a big question which is now discussed in Ukrainian Society how mobilization should look like how demobilization should look like I I'll come back to wider reaction in a moment but how many extra soldiers will this actually provide because back in December president zinski was talking about the need for half a million more today president zinski said that we don't have a need half a million I can't tell you how more will be mobilized in the AG age cons conscripted in the age of 25 26 years I just don't know but we're definitely speaking about thousands of people but what is very important we can't fight with Russia by numbers we will mobilize half million they will mobilize 1 million who will mobilize 1 million they will mobilize two they are much bigger country and with a much bigger Manpower so for us the most important is to have weapons modern effective from our allies to have a smart strategy smart tactics only by these we should win or no other way there is for us but but let's bring those two thoughts together because in terms of public support for this where are we because you've had president seninsky even in the last few days talking about again the lack of weapons from the West the lack of air cover the likely Russian push in May and June families ordinary families will be alarmed to be sending their 25y olds to war weren't they they will for sure and definitely that's a hard topic and um everybody who wanted to go to fight voluntarily they did it in 2022 so now we're speaking about people who don't want to fight but today yes some of them understand that they need to fight to protect their country some of them try to avoid these this is to also reality so my personal position is we need to have very clear and simple system when it is absolutely clear for example 18 months of service you know definitely how more alone will you serve you know that you will have rotations so you will not be all the time on the front line you know you will have vacations and all of this but once again we really I want to address you and those who are listening to us and watching us now Ukraine needs help in weapons now in ammunition now we don't have lack of people but we have lack of support from our partners who promised us to be with us as long as it takes and now it is not happening\"],\n [{\n            'v': 11,\n            'f': \"11\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-21 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Reddit share sale values

or IPO and if you're not familiar with Reddit it hosts Niche discussion groups or subreddits around a 100,000 of them on everything from politics to pets investing and hobbies in the world of Co in the words of co-founder and boss Steve Huffman Reddit topics range from the sublime to the ridiculous the trivial to the existential the IC to the serious around 73 million people use it every day so what's it worth Reddit has priced its shares at $34 giving it a stock market value of $6.4 billion at the start of trading that could of course go up or down once shares start trading but it is well below the $10 billion valuation given to Reddit by investors back in 2021 and to put all that in perspective social media giant meta which owns Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp was worth $1.2 trillion at the market close on Wednesday let's go live to Paul condra he's head of industry and Technology research at pitchbook which provides data on the global Capital markets and he's in Seattle Port Reddit may not be as famous as Facebook Instagram or X but it has 1.2 billion subscribers and an oversubscribed public listing so it's clearly a hot ticket is it scalable though can it reach the heights of those bigger companies uh well yeah I mean thanks for having me I think if you look at the daily active user count it's much lower than some of those larger properties you mentioned at about 70 73 million versus you know up into the billions for a company like meta and I think it caters to a much more Niche um type of use case um and the type of contributors and moderators that kind of want to run their subreddits um the way they see fit and they want to have more control over it whereas when you look at a you know a Facebook or an Instagram it's much more centrally managed so it's it's a different kind of business model um and I think it draws people in slowly but it also draws a lot of people in um that maybe want to get information quickly and get out because the kind of stickiness factors that exist in uh some of these larger platforms don't really exist in Reddit so yeah the opportunity really is you know how much do they want to go down that road of trying to use some of the techniques and models that some of their larger counterparts are using to make the platform stickier to make it a little more of an entertainment type of platform bring users in and try to monetize it a bit more effectively than they have in the past exactly I mean Paul you mentioned its business model and the fact that it needs to monetize it it doesn't make a profit it hasn't made a profit we've got a more competitive advertising Market it's signed this $60 million reported deal with allowing its data for training Google's AI models it's obviously got very valuable data from these discussions but I mean how is it going to raise the bottom line yeah I mean the the the the model was never really built to optimize advertising right it was built to provide a platform for creators and contributors and moderators kind of a decentralized um conversation space where people can be kind of have free reign on the things that they want to talk about and now so there now there's a bit of a pivot taking place uh for a company that wants to go public and wants to optimize that platform more effectively um they just raised a lot of money so that means they've got some Capital uh or they will have once this IPO is completed um they don't have any debt uh and so they've got the ability now to invest in the resources to say look we've got the traffic we've got the platform um but we don't really have is an advertising machine that really is optimized and capitalizes on that on what we have there so we can put the people and teams in place to start investing on that and they probably can make progress are they going to be able to grow it faster or take a bigger share of the market from their bigger competitors probably not but they can they can most likely turn that into a stronger business than what it is now um and then there's these secondary revenue streams that they're they've made some progress on which is selling the data um and that's become obviously very important in the last couple years with the rise of generative Ai and they have a pretty unique um data set a lot of IP on unique um valuable information across all these subreddits uh it's already proven to be somewhat valuable to Google who signed kind of a $60 million deal with them this year that can be an interesting Revenue stream probably a much higher margin Revenue stream I think there's a lot of questions around how big that can be but if we're just looking in the next couple years I think there's a lot of reasons this company can kind of put the pedal down in terms of generating more revenue and increasing the margin profile and and those are things to get people or at least get investors excited when you look at a valuation that's coming to the market that's not terribly expensive um to say hey this could be a good run for the next couple years it's probably not going to reach the scale of meta um but could be a good solid business if they're able to execute on those plans right and I guess they'll be watching out very closely for whether it affects the user experience at the same time Paul condra thanks so much for joining us\"],\n [{\n            'v':

and that the strikes were a limited Act of self-defense our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has the latest Israel is deciding how to respond to this hundreds of drones and missiles fired over the weekend from Iran damage on the ground was limited damage to Regional stability much more severe at an air base hit by missiles in the neav desert today Israel's Chief of Staff promised a response Iran will face the consequences for its actions we will choose our response accordingly the IDF remains ready to counter any threat from Iran and its Terror proxies Israel says only a half handful of missiles made it through air defenses but this direct confrontation with Iran the First on Israeli soil has thrown the Middle East off balance what's shaken Israel in these attacks isn't the damage caused but how they happened with drones and missiles sent straight from Iran and what these strikes left broken isn't so much infrastructure it's Iran's fear of launching a direct attack Iran's attack came with careful signaling its government warned Israel's allies of the strikes and said they were punishment for an assassination in Syria and that Iran now considered the matter closed our advice to all the supporters of the Zionist regime is to appreciate Iran's responsible and measured action and dissuade the Zionist regime from committing more wicked acts which would bring incalculable consequences but Israel has said it will exact a price from Iran its prime minister under pressure from allies to deescalate the situation has been discussing with his War cabinet exactly what that price should Beal one former Diplomat with experience of Iran says military action is only one option our military options are far more varied than the Iranians um and frankly the Iranian uh barrage was a a demonstration of weakness not of strength there's clearly uh a strong need for Israel to uh however it decides to respond and the respond can response can come in many different ways not just military Israel is already fighting iranian-backed groups in Gaza to the South and Lebanon to the north a far less powerful opponent delivered a major blow on the 7th of October Israel's challenge now is how to restore a fear of conflict in its biggest enemy without triggering a war Lucy Williamson BBC News Jerusalem our International editor Jeremy Bowen is here so as we heard Jeremy Israel continuing to insist it will retaliate even while the US is saying Iran has embarrassed itself well I think they're trying to get the message over to the Israelis that look yes your right to be concerned you have been attacked but this is under control look Iran's embarrassed itself it's not that simple though for the Israelis uh I think they feel the need very strongly to send a signal a really determined signal that they uh are not deterred in any sense by Iran there's something very deep in Israel's DNA that it has to push back it's not a question of turning the other cheek it's an eye for an eye at least uh that is something which is really part of their ethos but the gamble is always how is the other side going to respond because as you've heard the Iranians are also saying hang on this was self-defense we were just doing it to make a point also to restore to Terence and I think what they were also trying to do was uh to avoid making causing a large numbers of Civilian casualties which would have escalated matters so Israel is having those same similar kinds of discussions about the way that they need to go the Iranian Army Chief has said today in the last few hours he said something like our attack on Israel was limited if Israel retaliates there will be a far greater response you know from netanyahu's point of view for many years he has seen Iran as Israel's number one enemy bana I remember him saying to me in the BBC office in Jerusalem about about 2006 when armad was President he said look armad had is Hitler and it's 1938 you know it wasn't an exclusive he was saying it a lot at the time to people but that's very much his view now don't forget there's also the war in Gaza going on that's something which is still urgent it's still there's still the famine there is still military action going on there in the middle part of the Gaza Strip but as far as Israel's uh Western allies are concerned it is less of a priority these last few days than Iran Iran seems a lot more urgent doesn't mean to say that they've forgotten about what's going on there but instead of talking about differences potential war crimes famines they're talking about Unity coalitions facing Iran together\"],\n [{\n            'v': 13,\n            'f': \"13\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-15 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Corals turning white and dying after record

Administration in the last few minutes it's announced what it calls the fourth Mass Coral bleaching event is already underway well this is what's at risk mile after mile of coral reef slowly turning white or even dying out altogether by some estimates around 50% of coral has been lost in the last 20 years well let's get more on this development speak to our science reporter Georgina Renard who's in in The Newsroom for us and Georgina welcome here to the program this seems quite a disturbing new report bring us right up to date yes that's right so what this these us officials are saying is that we're now in the fourth Global Mass Coral bleaching event the first one was in 1998 and we've had two since then and now we're in the fourth one now what this means is uh Coral is is this very sensitive animal it lives often in Shallow Waters but when the water it's living in gets too hot it gets stressed it expels an algae that lives inside it and then it can turn white and often it can die and this is interesting also because we've been seeing for months these broken climate records ocean heat driving up and really seeing unprecedented levels of of warming in the oceans that's partly driven by climate change or mostly driven by climate change and also by El Nino this natural climate fluctuation that started last year we've been reporting on those broken records for months but this is now the first really solid Global evidence of just what that heat is doing to the oceans and to this really fragile sensitive ecosystem and these wreaths Coral build these vast cities underwater they're sometimes called the Seas Architects and inside those wreaths live a quarter of all marine life so this isn't just about these these amazing animals it's also about the rest of us our fishing and also the uh the income the trillions of dollars that coral reefs generate around the world and Georgina we're seeing coral reefs in all their Glory with all their colors but once the bleaching starts is there any way that it can be stopped or reversed that's one of the strange things the pictures actually look quite beautiful but scientists say up close when they dive in the water the coral is decaying and they can see it sort of coming apart unfortunately this is once the coral starts to to bleach um it's very difficult to turn back if it's given enough time it can recover but it needs one to even five years to get to get better and in that time it's quite susceptible to disease if there's enough time between these heat episodes it can get better um but at this rate that seems unlikely there are some local Solutions so some coral reefs um have had some successful restoration um they have managed to create some Coral that is resistant to these higher temperatures but all the sign scientist I've spoken to to prepare for this story they said that it's really a case of adapting to a future with a different type of coral and much less of it rather than really being able to save all of the coral reefs across the world's oceans now in previous bleaching events how much of the world's coral reefs were were actually lost so it's it's very difficult to tell exactly how much Coral uh mortality there's been that would require scientists to go to every single piece of coral reef in the world in the last episode which was 2014 to 2016 more than half of the world's uh corals were in waters that were too hot and in some areas we saw 25% 30% up to 50% mortality this episode that these us officials have just declared uh is still ongoing and they're saying they do expect that bleaching to surpass it and just one of the things to think about is that Coral provide this amazing home some of the sounds that they make that amazing creaking and almost singing H it's vital to the to the fish that that live in in the waters and when the fish actually use that creaking to find their way home and when the coral dies the fish lose that sound that's sort of the siren that takes them back uh and so what we see when the coral dies is fish and other animals can no longer find that way back to the these huge reefs that they call their home Georg we have to leave it there but thanks for bringing us right up to date on that breaking new report\"],\n [{\n            'v': 14,\n            'f': \"14\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-16 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Sydney

Orthodox Church on Monday was a terrorist act a teenage boy was arrested after a bishop and several churchgoers were stabbed while giving a sermon that was being streamed live online at least four people were stabbed but police said none of their injuries were life-threatening while the commissioner of New South Wales police explained why they are treating the attack as terrorism the things that influence my decision to declare this a terrorist incident was the actions of the individual who attended uh we we will alleged attended that church uh with a knife armed with a knife and uh stabbed the bishop and priest and others were also injured we believe there are elements that are satisfied in terms of religious um motivated extremism and of course the intim ation of the public through that person's acts well prime minister Anthony albanesi called for Unity in the wake of those attacks this is a disturbing incident there is no place for violence in our community there is no place for violent extremism we are a peace loving Nation this is a time to unite not divide as a community and as a country so let's talk now to our austr correspondent Katy Watson who's in wakeley the western Sydney suburb where the attack took place Katie good to have you with us and so police describing and declaring that attack as a terrorist act um what has been the reaction where you are well you can see behind me there are forensic teams still working um in the car park it's a crime scene um so it's still very early on uh in investigations um but this was you know attack that took place just two days after um the brutal stabbing in the shopping center in Bondi Junction and people here were really I mean you tensions are certainly High um what we saw last night was of course the stabbing that was live streamed and because of that there were crowds that quickly descended here um you know hundreds and hundreds of people came um outside and stood outside uh this church and at some point they turned on police uh there were police injured at one point paramedics and police were bar had to barricade themselves in the church um and and keep themselves inside um police have also said um that the attacker um had tips of his fingers cut off they're unsure whether that was self-inflicted or it happened in in the in the in the the riot situation certainly um you know all of this is currently being investigated so an awful lot really to to to digest and to try and get their heads around obviously the attack but also so the confrontations that we saw afterwards yes and we know the Prime Minister um convening that emergency meeting uh also uh urging people not to take the law into their own hands referring to some of those those protests and some of that unrest uh that unfolded there um but as you touch on there these two attacks in short succession in Australia I wonder what the general feeling is across Australia right now and whether there is a feeling of nervousness given what has happened and unfolded well certainly I mean obviously the tax aren't connected but speaking to people here there's a feeling that um what we saw last night was a trigger if you like trauma for many of the community who have uh fled countries like Syria and Iraq um to come to what they thought was a safe place uh and I think that's something that they it was an attack on their religion it was an attack in the church um and and of course tensions there you know Rose so there's certainly that that discussion is going on about how safe Australia is and that is replicated across Australia you know the the conversation I've heard time and time again in these last few days is this sort of thing doesn't happen in Australia but we've seen it happen and we've seen it happen twice in the last you know in in less than a week Katie for now thank you Katy Watson there live in Sydney for us thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n

time for our new weekly segment AI [Music] decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time of the week when we look in depth some of the more eye-catching stories in the world of artificial intelligence we're going to start with a Guardian newspaper it says according to Israeli intelligence sources Israel's military has been using an AI tool known as lavender to identify Hamas targets across Gaza Israel has rejected this and has released a statement which reads the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives next we have an opinion piece in the new Statesman why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence it asks whether existential anxiety about AI is just the patriarchy's fear of itself in a few minutes uh we see a robot called sfia respond to a question about how AI can come up with a road map to a more Equitable Society the Ft reports the US and the UK have signed a landmark agreement on artificial intelligence are becom the first countries to formally cooperate on how to test and assess risks from emerging AI models in the Wall Street Journal is the internet big enough to satisfy the huge appetite for data the world's leading AI companies need to grow the times reports more than 200 musicians asking technology companies to stop using their songs to train artificial intelligence models artists like Billy ish and RM are warning the music ecosystem is at risk of Destruction and finally are you ready for your fast food to be cooked by robots a US convenience chain says it's installed an AI powerered robotic system to give customers quote fully customizable fried chicken french fries and other items we'll show you that later with me is Stephanie hair technology author and AI commentator Stephanie great to have you as always uh should we start with a very sobering story on the front of the Guardian newspaper yes so we are looking at a new frontier in the field of warfare which is and it must be said that the Israeli Defense Force has denied this story but in the story which claims to site six Israeli Intelligence Officers who've all used a system called lavend to identify human targets and that's not particularly new the IDF has been using AI to identify buildings and structures as targets that was a system called The Gospel this new system though is called lavender and the differences rather than picking a build a building to attack or blow up they're going after humans so the question becomes who's responsible and who's making these decisions and is there proper human oversight the article would suggest not these six Intelligence Officers in the story claimed that they were spending about 20 seconds maximum to approve the targets that the AI was deciding for assassination that's time time scales will raise some eyebrows certainly just want to bring you the response quoted in the Guardian newspaper from uh the Israeli Army the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist adding information systems are merely tools for analysts in the Target identification process right let's move on to the front of the new Statesman this is one of those headlines isn't it why men shouldn't control artificial intelligence is strong enough but then the sub headline there existential anxiety about AI is just patriarchy's fear of itself Stephanie talk us through this I mean as a feminist this is a particularly enjoyable article to read but then with my British sense of fair play I had to go hm are we really saying that AI would be better designed if it was only being designed by women for instance or only people who are left-handed or only Americans versus peruvians so we have to really ask what is this article arguing for so it says you know projection is a mental process by which people attribute to others what they would actually do themselves so when you have a bunch of male billionaires the article argues not me I should say worrying about existential risk and domination the author makes the analogy that that's really because that's what an Elon Musk would do or that's what a Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg would do but it's not necessarily what all of us would do and hopefully not what a diverse inclusive team would do so it's really a call for diversity interest and that's real psychology isn't it it's basically going inside the brains of these people who are in charge and thinking what they're most scared of is a projection of their biggest weaknesses is and so therefore it's power and domination and so you've made the caveat that this not you where where do you stand on that as a as a theory though is it something that I mean presumably you're going to support diversity in of the people making these big decisions yes but not in a sort of politically correct woke way that some people might get very nervous about I'm actually looking at it in the perspective that we have here in this country with gchq which is neurodiverse teams more diverse teams perform better than monocultural teams because they see the world differently and in the domain of cyber security which is what gchq is all about keeping the country safe you need different perspectives to identify risk okay so it's a danger to just have group think I see okay well we know what the article thinks we now know what you think should we see what AI thinks now Bloomberg did a series where they asked a an AI robot Sophia um a series of questions one of them was how to make an AI system more Equitable potentially let's take a listen come up with a road map not just with a goal but with a road map for a more Equitable uh Society AI definitely has the potential to contribute to a more Equitable Society but it requires a collective effort and the inclusion of diverse perspectives we need to set ambitious goals for AI that prioritize issues like causing Global fairness and climate impact a road map can guide us towards achieving these goals and ensuring that AI serves the greater good Stephanie I don't want to say you could be replaced but that answer sounded a lot like the your answer I don't know what that means I don't know who came up with it first it might be a trained off of my book well good point good point right let's move to something potentially really important we've been following legislation attempts at regulation of course uh over the weeks and months us and UK signed Landmark agreement on testing safety of AI this is in the Ft what's this about I love this story it's all about how the US and the UK always want to be the first at having a safety Summit and now they're the first to agree that they're going to test AI but then you actually go into the article the United States AI safety Summit has actually done no work on this since the summit that we had back in November so they're signing lots of stuff but nobody's doing anything when you actually look into it they don't have the budget or the staff yet I'm sure the United States has other things going on so we can feel that this is hopeful but are we reassured I would say the jury is still out on this but it's still exciting to see countries committing to it and other governments will watch and the idea is I was at Bletchley Park for the for the UK and the signing and the announcements and the Great and the good were there and the idea is that rather than let private companies develop all this AI on their own actually they'll hand it over and so that the governments or government people uh who they're appointing can have a look inside and check it's actually safe is that right yes and the idea is that the US needs to be involved it can't just be the UK because most big AI companies or companies using AI are American but we have to acknowledge China is not anywhere involved in this agreement nor was it really involved with the summit very much and that is an AI superpower so again no resting on laurels when it comes to AI safety and as a principle do you think this model is going to be enough because like you say at the moment you're skeptical of resources and and uh time spent on it so far but let's presume that that does all come the agreements continue and they work together is it enough to warn and warn off the potential worst downsides of AI I would argue no we've got the EU AI act coming on quite soon the finalizing of that's happening this spring and a couple of years implementation that's a start but you know there's no rush to regulate here in the UK there's no rush to regulate in the United States so how are people going to be able to Sue how are they going to be getting responsibility and liability for when AI goes wrong and that's just in in the countries I've just listed AI is a global phenomenon it's like public health or climate change is going to have to involve every country on earth I think we're just at the beginning of building our AI sa safety infrastructure and just very lastly and quickly on this because you me things like China now China were invited I remember to BL part to day one of the summit but not today to when they've really talked about more sensitive things how do you see China and other countries working with China well right now it's very awkward because China keeps stealing people's data and launching cyber security attacks and then getting caught for it so it's hard to work with them and have trust at the same time they can't be left out of the discussion we're constantly working to find common ground with them and we must respect the work that they're doing some of it's very impressive interesting right let's move on to Wall Street Journal because this is interesting for data guzzling AI companies the internet is too small what what does that mean the internet is too small I love that it's like you know water water everywhere and not a drop to drink this is you think the internet has loads of data and you think that the world existence not just human but all of it is something that could be datafied and it could but it hasn't yet and that's what this article makes so beautiful most of the data available online is useless for AI training because it contains flaws it's not structured properly um this researcher who's quoted thinks that it's about a tenth of the information gathered is useful most of what's on the Internet is garbage who knew wow and so is there any kind of solution of course um there's going to be a whole field some of the most Cutting Edge research is going to be looking to structure data to create synthetic data which is where it's actually generated from within a company rather than going out and getting it and extracting it we are again on the cusp of this so I love that we've identified the problem it the problem answers with a solution we will have a new field being created interesting well that feeds into this next story which is something again we are going to continue to return to musicians from Billy eish to AR M unite to demand protection from AI so this is AI going out and crawling the internet and these artists these musicians want it to stop well I mean quite and it's not just musicians it's actors it's it's writers whose books might be being copied and turn into Bloomberg videos you just don't know do you because there's no real regulation there's no playing field on this so right now you've got the New York Times suing Microsoft and open AI saying you can't train on the New York Times so until we get a couple of loss suits that finally make a decision that's one way of solving it or we can have what the musicians are asking for which is kind of like a good behavior pledge that always works very well um right or we could get some actual laws passed so again let's see how it plays out and specifically on the music then you've got AI going out and listening to Billy eish or whatever and and using that to do what to try and come up with his with its own songs so many things so you could be impersonating a singer so like take take a great song like Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin and give me the version as sung by Dolly Parton which I would love to hear by the way so you could do that but does Miss Parton get paid for that does le zeppin get paid for that did they have consent in that Etc somebody could put that on the internet and I'm sure will right now after putting it out right like it'ss just that quickly uh that you can do this so that's one thing but it could also be training off of their lyrics and even off of their musical composition and Arrangement which is that's their proprietary product and and so is the is the potential end game I don't know whether it is anyone's end game that but that it could learn AI would learn all the different styles off all the different artists out there and then basically just keep on generating its own music and we would go on to whatever our music playlists are and just listen to AI generated stuff and we don't need any well I think it could get quite derivative it's sometimes like when your favorite band maybe goes on too long and needs to stop touring it could just sometimes they have a golden period and you wish they'd stopped no I'm I'm not commenting on any of that right we've got one one last article to look out this is The Verge now there's an AI gas station with robot fry Cooks uh we'll take a look at it in action whilst you explain what's going on so okay okay sorry so this robot is g to be making your chicken wings for you to be honest it can make any food and Fries um obviously there's not going to be any fun banter with this chef but efficient and in theory controlled product every time so you would be able to get the same thing if you gave it specification I wanted Cajun I wanted jerk chicken I wanted you know tender um dark meat only Etc so why is that interesting fully customizable fried chicken and french fries I mean don't get me wrong I love both of these things dearly a the the realm of variety isn't as big as you'd think and B do you need a robot for that is that a problem that needs solving is that a problem that needs solving that's a good question to end on I'm afraid we are out of time Stephan thank you so much we are out of time we'll do the same again next\"],\n [{\n            'v': 16,\n            'f': \"16\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-29 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Evan Gershkovich: One year since Russia jailed the US

in Russia Mr gershkovich is the first American to be charged with spying by the Russian authorities since the end of the Cold War the US government and the Wall Street Journal have dismissed the charge they say Mr gershkovich is being used as a bargaining chip by Moscow well I'm joined Now by Dr gulosa s from the committee to protect journalists and independent non profit organization that promotes press Freedom uh Dr s thank you very much for your time what's the the latest information first of all that you have on how Evan is doing thank you for having me uh today is the first anniversary since Evan gich is detention in Moscow on absolutely bogus charges and just a few days ago on March 26 the Russian authorities extended his detention by another three months which means that he's going to stay in pre-trial detention uh until unless uh until the end of uh June and uh then we are hoping uh that the trial will start but he is accused of Espionage as you said and this is a very heavy charge and Espionage charges uh usually end with conviction in Russia so he's very likely to be convicted he is looking into up to 20 years in Russian jail what do you read into that extension of the pre-trial detention though rather than moving closer to the actual trial could it indicate that conversations to try to uh free Evan gershkovich are actually uh making some progress or at least are remaining very active I hope they are remaining uh very active and I hope that we're close to the moment when he will be uh released and uh return to the United States and uh to his family to his parents and sibling but uh everything we know from previous Trials of journalists accused of Espionage uh is that usually uh pre-trial detentions are very long uh followed by trials uh hel held behind closed doors so I think the most likely scenario is that Evan is tried and convicted first before the US and Russian authorities agree on the prisoner exchange how difficult is it for journalists in Russia at the moment to to go about their business to work given the the current climate look it's never been easy to be an independent reporter in Putin's Russia Putin has been uh in power for close to a quarter of a century and from the beginning he made it his goal to control the flow of information uh but until Evan's detention a year ago uh foreign correspondents who worked in Russia although knew they were at risk they probably didn't expect some something as harsh as ESPN charges uh because we know of other cases of journalists including uh BBC correspondents who were not very who did not feel very welcome especially after Russia started its full SC invasion of Ukraine but with evans's case the Russian authorities uh send a signal that nothing is uh beyond their whims beyond their control and everything is possible as you know evans's case is the first case of an American journalist uh charged with Espionage in Russia since uh the end of the Cold War so now every journalist foreign or local is at risk of immediate imprisonment uh in Russia okay Dr gulosa s from the committee to protect journalists joining us from New York thank you very much thank you\"],\n

cooperation between the two countries top of the agenda of course in the background tensions with China never far from the mind with well a number of Western governments right let's take a look at what's been happening there we go President Biden is hosting Japan's prime minister fumio kashida there at the White House there have been military guards of Honor they also be a state dinner in the next couple of hours now the talks are part of the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts in Asia there were recent war games in Soul and take a look at these pictures this is the weekend the US Japan Philippines and Australia held joint military exercises in the South China Sea the Chinese military conducted combat Patrols in the same area and speaking a little earlier President Biden said Japan the US and Australia will together boost military capabilities including uh through the creation of an air missile Network Biden said the upgrades were defensive in nature this is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of since it was first established I'm also pleased to announce that for the first time Japan and the United States and Australia will create a network system of air missile and defense architecture we're also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom and our Aus defense partnership with Australia in the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar which focuses on Advanced capabilities including AI autonomous systems all told that represents a new Benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities right let's speak to Mary mcarthy professor of political science Drake University specializing in Japan's domestic and foreign policy thank you very much for coming on the program thank you so much for having me right there were lots of words that Joe Biden was just saying trilateral capabilities uh lots of other slightly jargony technical missile capabilities can you please attempt to explain that for us well I think the to start off we have to say that the meeting this week between Biden and kashida coming on the heel of these military exercises that were just mentioned is extremely important it is a signal to both domestic and international audiences we know that one of the target audiences is certainly China but it's not only China it's the International System in general as well as domestic audiences in the US and in Japan and and so I think that the second important thing to really highlight is that the announcements today are not coming out of nowhere out of the blue they are the culmination of months of hard work by the Biden and kishida administrations as well as the governments in Australia in the Philippines and elsewhere and so this is so let's just focus on on exactly that the mention there of Australia the mention of uh the UK Britain will hold regular joint military exercises in the Indo Pacific with the US and Japan from 2025 uh to boost Security in the region that's from the uh Ministry of Defense here in the UK that role with Australia too as well as Japan where does all this leave China so I think it has become increasingly clear that so-called likeminded states in the Asia Pacific are cooperating and coordinating more closely certainly on defense and security but also on what is now called Economic Security resilient Supply chains closer economic relationships and we see Japan and Australia both taking clear steps to be in lock step with the US with regard to its position in the Asia Pacific and seeing China today as a strategic challenge or perhaps even a strategic threat whereas previously there was a lot more efforts on the part of Japan and Australia to enhance the partnership elements of their relationships with China yeah lots of uh political discourse based around the difference between the world word challenge and threat we haven't got time to go into that now because I want to talk about space that was mentioned astronauts us Japan cooperation is this something we should read anything into it is I think it represents two important elements of the US Japan relationship one is that the relationship is multifaceted it is not only a security relationship it is not only an economic relationship there are so many issues on which the US and Japan are should and could be cooperating and space is one and the second important thing to keep in mind is that space is not something frivolous oh oh it'll be great the Japanese astronaut will be on the Moon yes that's wonderful it will be exciting for the Japanese public to see but it's really important to keep in mind that space is an element of International Peace and security and that us and Japan cooperating in space is also an element of their defense and security relationship okay Mar mcarthy thank you very much for coming on the program thank you thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v':

from their homes cities under threat evacuations ongoing while the flooding in the urals and Western Siberia has been caused by unseasonably warm temperatures which has melted the snow in the Russian city of orenberg home to half a million people The Authority said water levels had reached dangerous levels thousands of people have already left the city orenberg is Downstream from the city of os which was inundated when a dam burst last week well let's go straight to Moscow and straight to our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg and Steve just give me a sense of the scale of this first of all well the first thing to say is that uh spring flooding is common right in in Russia um when winter turns to Spring and and the snow melts we see flooding but nothing on this scale I mean and it's beyond Russia right in you mentioned Kazakhstan 97,000 people have been evacuated from the flood zone in Kazakhstan uh as for Russia more than 12,000 people have been evacuated uh from their homes uh you mentioned orenberg I think more than 7,000 people have been evacuated from from orenberg and uh boats have been uh uh sailing around the city there um Sirens wailing uh people being called on to to leave leave their homes in in different districts uh of the city so the scale is quite big uh and there's an economic consequence here too um as far as we know casualty figures are low at the moment uh I've heard maybe four or five people have been killed over the last few days uh in this flooding but uh it's flooding which has affected lots of communities lots of settlements in the area of the Ural M mountains and Western Siberia we're seeing pictures aerial pictures of just the huge amount of territory that this flooding is actually uh actually hitting and impacting are the water levels still Rising talk me through the amount of help people are getting on the ground the water levels as far as we know are still Rising uh in orenburg uh and in fact uh President Putin spokesman de pesov uh earlier today um said that the situation was expected to get worse in other places water levels have fallen for example in the the town of Ork that you mentioned it was quite interesting a few days ago uh a crowd an Angry Crowd gathered in Ork to uh vent their Fury uh on local officials on the regional governor of orenberg on the local mayor uh who they believe didn't warn them in time that this flood was coming uh they criticized Russia's Minister for emergency situations too they didn't criticize the Kremlin which is quite interesting they were actually chanting Putin help us Putin help us as if you know the president sitting in the Kremlin in Moscow was the goods are in according to Russian tradition some that they believe could actually help uh solve their problems give them compensation uh make things better exactly on that point with Vladimir Putin has he said anything about this himself directly we see him so vocal on International matters the operation in Ukraine what about something like this domestically with people calling for him to step in have we heard from him at all so the official message uh from the Kremlin is that Vladimir Putin is across this completely he's being in kept informed he is uh dealing with the situation coordinating the situation um we haven't seen that yet we haven't seen the pictures of this and there's no suggestion at the moment that Vladimir Putin is going to visit uh the flood the flood area um at the moment um the message is being put out there that the president is in full control of the situation but we haven't actually seen evidence for that Steve Rosenberg live there in Moscow thanks very much for that thank you\"],\n [{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-10 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC

Jennifer Crumbley are the first to be held responsible for a gun attack carried out by their teenage son Ethan Crumbley killed four classmates and injured seven others in 2021 at the Oxford High School he's serving life in prison without parole his parents were both found guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter and face 10 to 15 years in prison each of the defendants gross negligence has caused unimaginable suffering to hundreds of others as a result of what happened that day each Act or inaction created a ripple effect therefore an out of guideline sentence is appropriate and proportional the court uses the youthful useful tool of the legislative guidelines which embody the the principles of proportionality while also taking into account the nature of the offense and the background of each defendant I believe that the following sentences would be in the best interest of justice and are reasonable and proportionate to the seriousness of the matter and the circumstances surrounding each defendant with regard to Jennifer Crumley it is the sentence of this court Miss Crumley that you sered 10 to 15 years with the Michigan Department of Corrections to defendant James Crumley it is the sentence of this court that you serve 10 to 15 years years with the Michigan Department of Corrections well let's speak now to Kim bware who has been following this story for the Washington Post Kim thank you very much for joining us um as we said a landmark case what's the reaction been to the sentences I think this is the sentence that the families the victims family members had wanted and this is a sentence that for a lot of people in this community do feel is the right one given the egregious facts in this case and the gun had been given to James and Jennifer crumley's teenage son as a Christmas present yeah the the gun ownership how the gun was stored these were the big things that the case hinged on and these were the things that also judge Cheryl Matthews mentioned right before she read her sentence she said that Mr Crumbley had left the gun um accessible to this child and that Jennifer Crumbley had glorified the use of this weapon um we know now that the gun was purchased a few days before the shooting by the father and that the mother had taken the shooter to a shooting range to practice with it beforehand and those were facts that came up in both of their trials as not only deeply upsetting but really highlighting the negligence that uh the prosecutors were trying to illustrate how significant Kim could any precedent set by this case be this is really um at the Leading Edge of a kind of prosecutions that are relatively new uh there was a case in Lake County Illinois outside of Chicago where the father of uh the Highland Park shooter was given a misdemeanor uh or he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge but this is the most serious I mean this is definitely one that it is unprecedented and it is creating a framework uh other prosecutors around the country have said it's creating a framework for how they can potentially hold parents or Guardians accountable when their children pick up weapons and hurt somebody and briefly Kim for those in the US who want to see much tighter controls and guns do they think that this case these sentences could could make a difference that's still a little bit unclear when the shooting happened the state of Michigan actually didn't have a safe storage gun law so there was no legal requirement that the parents lock up their guns there is still an overall legal duty to store them responsibly there is a law now and it was in part because of this shooting and at Michigan State University but it's definitely giving prosecutors and lawmakers you know a reason to give a second look at existing gun laws and say you know maybe we can do something a little more to um up the expectations of of parents who have guns when they also have children in the home okay Kim bware thank you very much\"],\n [{\n            'v': 21,\n            'f': \"21\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-09 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"European court rules human rights violated by climate

group of elderly women by failing to adequately fight climate change well the court said that Switzerland's efforts to meet its emission reduction targets had been woefully inadequate the Judgment also ruled that the women had been denied access to justice as their case had been rejected by all Swiss courts well we recently heard from the Swiss president Viola amard who said sustainability biod diversity and Net Zero are very important to Switzerland she said the country would continue to keep working on them well that came as two other cases were ruled inadmissible now in those six Portuguese Youth and a French mayor were also attempting to force their governments and others in Europe to take more ambitious action to fight climate change well in a moment we will hear from a climate change lawyer but first let's have a listen to climate activist Greta tunberg who shared her reaction to today's verdicts today's rulings make very clear that European states have a legal responsibility to take real climate action and to protect people and to protect its citizens um it cannot be a political Choice whether to respect human rights or not Greta tunberg there will Tessa CS an international climate change lawyer and the executive director of uplift it's a climate campaign group I spoke to her earlier about these cases well it's a case that was brought um on behalf of a large group of elderly Swiss women um on the basis that older women in particular are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change we've seen for example with heat waves that are driven or made more intense by climate change that when those hit it's often the elderly and elderly women in particular whose Health suffers and so they've brought this case arguing that Switzerland uh climate change policies its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions uh is inadequate to protect the health the housing the human rights of Swiss women and they've succeeded and the courts confirmed today that it is a legally binding obligation that governments have to make sure that their climate change policies are sufficient to protect people's human rights so it's a really significant finding you say it's significant Tessa but how of it is actually symbolic what would the Swiss government now have to do following this ruling well like any government that is found to be in breach of its legal obligations it's now under an obligation to align its action with what the law requires so what's clear although you know I'm yet to read the 100 Page Plus judgment in detail but in the past when courts have made these sorts of findings and they have made these sorts of findings in other countries in the past it requires governments to be more ambitious in terms of their policies to cut carbon emissions they've got to stop burning fossil fuels at the pace that they currently do so the path of action is very clear and Tessa it wasn't all good news for people filing those cases today we had some young people in Portugal and a mayor in France whose cases were ruled inadmissible once again if you could just tell us a little bit about those two cases yeah certainly so the case on behalf of Portuguese young people was brought again because there was real concern that the way that the impacts of climate change have been playing out in Portugal which is you know increasingly intense and frequent wildfires heat waves those are having really tangible impacts on the lives and on the health of young people in Portugal and so again they've argued that it's a breach of their human rights in this instance the court didn't make any finding as to whether or not um the portug government or any other European government is in fact breaching their human rights they simply made a finding that those young people should have ventilated that claim they should have gone first to court in Portugal before going to a higher Court which is the European Court of Human Rights so they didn't actually engage with the merits of that argument at all they simply said that it wasn't the right Forum in which to hear that claim and you work in this field uh of legal uh cases around climate are we likely to see more of these kind of cases coming up how widespread um is it for people around the world to bring such cases well we absolutely will see more of these kinds of cases it's already a widespread phenomenon there are literally dozens of cases that are currently playing out in countries around the world it's not just limited to the UK and Europe although there is an active case in UK Courts at the moment challenging the robustness and the credibility of the UK government's climate change policy but you know we've seen cases in Latin America in Africa in Australia in the US they are everywhere and the findings of the Court the European Court of Human Rights today will I think only underline that this is an issue that rises to the question of whether or not governments are acting lawfully and inevitably I think we will see as people get more and more desperate as they continue to see governments failing to act with the seriousness and the speed that's required they will inevitably turn to courts more and more\"],\n [{\n            'v': 22,\n            'f': \"22\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-21 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"US accuses Apple of monopolising

a decade iPhone sales have made up a majority of Apple's annual revenue today Apple's share of the US performance smartphone market exceeds 70% and its share of the entire us smartphone market exceeds 65% Apple charges as much as nearly $1600 for an iPhone but as our complaint alleges Apple has maintain Monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating Federal antitrust law consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law we allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary anti-competitive conduct that hurts both consumers and Developers for consumers that has meant fewer choices higher prices in fees lower quality smartphones apps and accessories and less Innovation from Apple and its competitors for developers that has meant being forced to play by rules that insulate Apple from competition and as outlined in our complaint we allege that Apple has Consolidated its Monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse Apple carries out its exclusionary anti-competitive conduct in two principal ways first Apple imposes contractual restrictions and fees that limit the features and functionality that developer can offer iPhone users second Apple selectively restricts access to the points of connection between third-party apps and the iPhone's operating system degrading the functionality of non-apple apps and accessories as a result for most of the past 15 years Apple has collected a tax in the form of a 30% Commission on the price of any app downloaded from the App Store as well as on inapp purchases apple is able to command these fees from companies of all sizes Apple has also suppressed the emergence of programs like Cloud streaming apps including gaming apps as well as super apps that could reduce user dependence on Apple's own operating system and expensive hardware and as any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message or received a tiny grainy video can attest Apple's anti-competitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-apple products it does this by diminishing the functionality of its own messaging app and by diminishing the functionality of third-party messaging apps by doing so Apple knowingly and deliberately degrades quality privacy and security for its users for example if an iPhone user messages a non-phone user in apple messages the text appears not only as a green bubble but incorporates limited functionality the conversation is not in red videos are pixelated and grainy and users cannot edit messages or see typing indicators as a result iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse even though apple is the one responsible for breaking crossplatform messaging and it does so intentionally for example in 2013 a senior executive at Apple explained that supporting crossplatform messaging in apple messages quote would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones close quote in 2022 Apple's CEO was asked whether Apple would fix iPhone to Android messaging the questioner added quote not to make it personal but I can't send my mom certain videos close quote Apple's CEO CEO responded buy your mom and iPhone in addition to selectively controlling app distribution and creation we allege that apple is violating the law by conditionally restricting developers access to the interface which is needed to make an app functional on the Apple operating system for a product like a smartwatch or a digital wallet to be useful to an iPhone user it must be able to communicate with the iPhone's operating system but Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem when it comes to SmartWatches Apple not only drives users to purchase an Apple Watch which is only compatible with an iPhone it also uses its Technical and contractual controls to make it harder for someone with an iPhone to use a non-apple smartwatch and when it comes to digital wallets Apple's exclusionary conduct goes a step further digital wallets allow users to store and use passes and credentials in a single app including credit cards personal identification movie tickets and car keys Apple wallet is Apple's proprietary digital wallet on the iPhone Apple actively encourages Banks merchants and other parties to participate in apple wallet but it's simultaneously exerts its Monopoly power to block these same Partners from developing alternative payment products and services for iPhone users for example Apple has blocked thirdparty developers from creating competing digital Wallets on the iPhone they use what is known as tap to pay functionality that is the function that makes a digital wallet well a wallet instead Apple forces those who want to use the wallet function to share personal information with apple even if they would prefer to share that information solely with their Bank medical provider or other trusted third party when an iPhone user puts a credit or debit card in apple wallet Apple inserts itself into the process that would otherwise occur directly between the user and the card issuer this introduces an additional potential point of failure for the privacy and security of Apple users and that is just one way in which apple is willing to make the iPhone less secure and less private in order to maintain its Monopoly power the Supreme Court defines Monopoly power as quote the power to control prices or exclude competition as set out in our complaint Apple has that power in the smartphone market now having Monopoly power does not itself violate the antitrust laws but it does when a firm acquires or maintains Monopoly power not because it has a superior product or Superior business acument but by engaging in exclusionary conduct as set out in our complaint Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority because of its unlawful exclusionary Behavior monopolies like apples threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based they stifle Innovation they hurt producers and workers and they increase costs for consumers if left unchallenged Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone Monopoly but there's a law for that the justice department will vigorously enforce and I trust law enforcing the law protects consumers from higher prices and fewer choices that is a Justice Department's legal obligation that is what the American people expect that is what they deserve\"],\n [{\n            'v': 23,\n            'f': \"23\",\n        },\n\"2024-03-25 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Boeing boss to leave as firm faces safety crisis  | BBC

1348,\n            'f': \"1348\",\n        },\n\"uh yeah first up let's start with Boeing all change the playmaker has revealed that its chief executive David Calhoun will leave by the end of this year the company also said the boss of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for reelection The Firm of course is under pressure after a door panel on a plane blew out in midair in January no one was injured during the incident but the firm's safety record has come under renewed scrutiny well let's get more on this now from John Grant who's an independent Aviation analyst good afternoon to you and firstly change at the top does often follow this sort of thing doesn't it but do you think this will address the underlying issues here regarding safety but it's John strippin by the way rather than John Grant oh apologies John my apologies I badly misinformed there but so yeah there has been these underlying issues hasn't there uh with the technical side of things safety wise yeah do you feel like this will convince people I think this marks a fundamental change and of course we're talking about a time scale the head of boing commercial airplanes leaving immediately the CEO still in post till the end of the year I'm not normally a person who would flippantly say regime change is necessary but I think this is very very symbolic and critical to Boeing's Rehabilitation to go back to position of where it was a preeminent industry manufacturing known for quality and obviously above all safety we've seen so much much going on in the last couple of years since we had the the grounding of the the max eight aircraft after two fatal crashes we've had the last few months one day after another news flow since we had the door come out of the Alaska 737 I think what this does is send a message in every respect internally to the workforce that at the top things are changing it's a break from the past outwardly both to uh Airline customers many of whom have been critical uh of the business if not directly calling for the head of the CEO and the head of commercial airplanes and of course to to the traveling public as well and and indeed Wall Street so it's going to take some months to do and I think what we need to do is look to the Future and make sure that now this this is going to happen that the right people are indeed appointed to have the right skill set the right experience to lead going forward take it out of this very unfortunate period of years it's experienced recently uh what do you think the impact might be on passengers when we see major surgery needed like this does tend to hit uh the production line for example and then that Finds Its way through the tickets well there should be no effect on on production I mean it is a technical business for our production processes of course the focus for spotlight is already on quality the lack of quality the the failures we've seen that have led to the most recent accident for example that work has to continue Dave cohon while he is still CEO has said that he'll do everything possible to ensure that it's put right the removal of executives below him now including Stan deal head of commercial airplanes recently the head of the 737 program the one which is primarily of a spotlight have happened but those processes have to continue to be one adhered to strengthened we have The Regulators not least for FAA looking with close scrutiny boeings in the midst of a 90-day period when he has to come up with an action plan to put these things right so it has to continue deliveries are still taking place to airlines that in itself is a challenge for many delays a lot of unhappy C customers including Ryan Air for example but from a customer point of view yeah maybe there could be some peripheral impact on ticket prices this summer because capacity tight we've again already heard that from Ry a and others Boeing is not alone in in having aircraft with uh technical challenges this sub capacity is tight but I think uh daytoday the industry will perform within those constraints as it otherwise would okay John listen John Strickland there Strickland thank you very much indeed for your time there for analysis on Boeing well let's uh get a bit more reaction from New York on this I think we can cross now to Michelle flurry our North America business correspondent Michelle uh early days on the stock market I guess the reaction though has been been pretty good so far uh will this be enough do you think to to convince shareholders investors I I mean I think there's a sense at least initially uh from analysts and investors that this will kind of help the share price uh in part uh they think it's a positive shake up for Boeing uh that this is a step forward in an attempt to win back trust um that being said though it is just a first step you know I wanted to read you a sort of quote we had from someone throwing a bit of skepticism um saying look uh there could be some cultural change happening at boing we've long thought that the issues at Boeing have been seated in cultural challenges that was Cameron Dawson um who is Chief investment officer at New Age wealth I think a lot will depend on who Calhoun's successor ultimately is and how far the company is able to show that it is changing the culture from the top um and so that really is sort of going to be the kind of the test here but obviously the company felt it had to do something it was under increasing pressure not just from the financial sector but you also saw from government officials and indeed from its customers and I think that's why you've got Dave for example saying he is going to step down falling on his sword and trying to kind of address some of the criticism that has been leveled at this company yeah I I mean normally with this we do get sort of big changes as I was just chatting there with John um I mean do you sort of feel like the trick is they have to show they taking some serious action but kind of keep business carrying on as normal as best as possible not too much Tom I'll just try and steady things well look I mean I think you know what makes Boeing different from certainly other companies is is that you're talking about essentially two main players in this market Boeing is the American sort of major player here uh the European other player is Airbus essentially we're talking about a duopoly when there are only two players I think ultimately uh the customers in this case the airlines don't really have much alternative in terms of where they can turn to to try and buy their aircraft they're already facing these long delays waiting for deliveries of planes I mean who else are they going to go to where are they going to go air bus is already sort of uh pretty much at full capacity and so I think Boeing has room to get it right but what we're seeing here is the pressure on the company to say you need to go further and I think this is the attempt by management and the speed with which you're seeing the head of the commercial uh side of the company leaving immediately not waiting uh I think they're trying to send a message we are trying to write the ship but right now A once Great American company uh is certainly struggling\"],\n [{\n            'v': 24,\n            'f': \"24\",\n

held accountable when incidents occur everyone in this Camp knows someone who has been killed injured or is missing but survivors like Ahmad still believe there will be an end to this brutal War we

was the hottest March ever recorded new figures from the eu's cernus climate service extend the world's run of record-breaking air temperatures to 10 consecutive months the average was 0.1 Celsius above the previous High set in 2016 a significant margin by global standards our climate editor Justin rout reports last week the president of Zimbabwe declared a national disaster because of a deep drought in the country low rainfall has slashed crop yields driving up food prices and putting an estimated 2.7 million people at risk of hunger it is just one example of a pattern of heat and drought affecting countries as far a field as southern Europe and Southeast Asia this graph shows how march continued the world's run of record-breaking monthly temperatures this extreme heat has got many climate scientists worried the reality is that we can quantify a large proportion of the the extra heat that's causing these records but not all of it so there needs to be a lot more science and there will be much more science coming out over the next weeks and months to try and understand what's happening to our climate system and are we in a new phase scientists agree what is causing climate change it is the vast quantities of Planet warming gases Humanity has been pumping into the atmosphere and in recent months a recurring weather event known as El Nino has been adding an extra blast of heat into the air that is weakening now so temperatures should begin to fall back later in the year the problem is sea temperatures remain extremely high hitting many of the world's coral reefs hard that suggests global temperatures might not fall back as expected a sign fear some scientists that the world could be entering a new phase of more rapid climate change Justin rollat BBC News let's get some analysis now with Dr Khloe brimham climate scientist and heat wav researcher at the University of Gratz in Austria welcome to you thanks very much for being with us um what are your thoughts your analysis on this latest report and these figures so I think that it's now not a surprise to see these temperature records being broken month on month and as uh Justin roll out was saying um we know that this is to do with um elino also adding heat into the system and so we're seeing these temperatures consecutively broken but also the extreme weather events like that in Zimbabwe that we're seeing and elsewhere in the world and what consequences do you think we're likely to see in the coming months so we're coming into the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere and that's where most people live and and so we know that we're going to likely to see an increase in the number of heat waves I can't sell you exactly right now because it's too far in advance but we are likely to see heat waves increase in sort of drought conditions but also increases in things like flash flooding and wildfires basically the same as what we've seen um in past summers in recent years and so it is quite concerning that we might be entering a new climate phase yeah and we have seen a record-breaking temperatures both on land and in the sea over the past several months haven't we uh we constantly hear about a a Tipping Point where climate change accelerates and becomes Unstoppable are you fearful that we've reached that point I think that we all need to be hopeful so tipping points a two side of a coin and so we have positive social tipping points so if we all come together like we did on covid we can um basically Al it's never too early to start um slowing the tide on climate change and making things better for basically all of us we've also seen reports in the news recently of um the price of chocolate Rising because of climate change and so I think we keep seeing these reports and it's affecting Europe also growingly and we just need to act on it and we know what we need to do we know we need a transition to Net Zero we know we need to put in place support for count in the global sou for the worst impacts of climate change and so now is the time to start acting and and hopefully by month 11 of record-breaking uh temperatures we will hopefully start to see that yeah you say now is a time to start acting I mean sadly we've heard that for many years haven't we the UN holds a climate conference every year cop where countries commit to various things with regards to emissions targets do you feel that you know the world world leaders have come to grips with this they are dealing with this and if not why not what is stopping us I don't think that world leaders have come to grips with this I think there are probably standout Nations that are doing more than others um I think that it's very difficult because at cop you're trying to call for Global consensus and it's very difficult to get everybody to agree on one thing the standout environmental standard that does that is the Montreal protocol which um you know stops cfc's um and started closing the ozone hole and so if we can get the same sort of commitment um from countries and the same sort of progress we could have that same turnaround for climate change it's just getting the commitment there and putting sort of um National fiveyear agendas behind us and thinking of long-term goals and I think that's what been the challenge but also the communication and just how urgent this actually is and the realization that this is affecting societies right now and we need to act on this right now not in a 100 years Time Dr Chloe brim I'm really interesting to get your thoughts and Analysis thank you

Trump said he was responsible for the 2022 Supreme Court decision ending a federal right to the procedure adding that in his view abortion was now where everybody wanted it to be from a legal standpoint he didn't specify a gestational week at which he would ban abortion but he said he supported exceptions for rape incest and to protect the life of the mother many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended row v Wade they wanted it ended it must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even even beyond the 9th month the concept of having an abortion in the later months and even execution after birth and that's exactly what it is the baby is born the baby is executed after birth is unacceptable and almost everyone agrees with that my view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint the states will determine by Vote or legislation or perhaps both and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the state many states will be different many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others and that's what they will be at the end of the day this is all about the will of the people you must follow your heart or in many cases your religion or your faith do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself do what's right for your children do what's right right for our country and vote so important to vote at the end of the day it's all about will of the people that's where we are right now and that's what we want the will of the people well Michael Sherer National political reporter with the Washington Post gave me his reaction well he's definitely been leaning in that direction for a number of months there were a couple Kur fuff during the primary in which he said similar things about not wanting a federal Banner as campaign did about uh Republican voters needing to respect the will of the people and then he would back off of that because he was in a Republican primary this is really a political move he's got an enormous headwind and actually you know Republicans running Statewide for Senate have enormous headwind abortion has really motivated Democratic voters and he's trying to uh dampen down that issue he knows it's something that uh you know really threatens to defeat him in November and he's trying to take away the idea that as president he would push for a federal ban even though during his term as president president he did push for a 20we ban uh and and members of his party are going to continue to push for a ban and he's previously said he would work something out um this won't change what the Biden campaign's doing they're going to spend you know2 200 300 million dos on Advertising you know saying that the reason in a lot of these key swing States you no longer have the same access to abortion is uh is President Trump and row and probably surfacing some of his old comments in which he did call for basically a ban on abortion I mean at one point and he took this back he even called for um prosecution of of women who had abortions um so this doesn't take the issue off the table but he's hoping it will reduce the severity of it for himself and I know it is very early because this statement has only just come out but is it likely to you know reduce opposition from potential supporters so I I think it's a complicated question I don't think we know the answer uh you know the the there is going to be some backlash from the right from his conservative Evangelical supporters who have long supported Federal uh legislation restricting abortion he's basically ruling that out here he has previously supported Federal legislation now whether those people stay home or vote third party is is you know an open question they probably don't um I don't think this has you know it like it's a matter of degree it doesn't change completely the conversation if you look at a lot of the state stes where this presidential election is going to be decided Georgia North Carolina Michigan Wisconsin Arizona abortion is very much a live issue on the state level the only reason it's a live issue on the state level is uh that roie Wade was overturned and and president Trump is claiming credit for overturning roie Wade so it doesn't take him out of the conversation about abortion and I think uh Biden will be able to go to voters and say look the reason you're concerned that you or your daughter or your wife are going to have trouble getting abortion access uh right now is is that President Trump did this and and President Biden is running on a platform of restoring roie Wade uh on the federal level\"],\n [{\n            'v': 27,\n

minority ringas have been conscripted to fight for myanmar's embattled military Jun the BBC has learned that is despite the fact that ringas are denied citizenship and are subjected to a range of discriminatory restrictions including a ban on travel outside their communities well our southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan headed is in Bangkok and told me more about what he's learned well with my burmes colleagues we've spoken to um seven different people in Five camps now you have to remember that while uh millions of ringers have left rakine State 700,000 were driven out in the Dreadful attacks on them by the military back in 2017 an operation described by the UN as possible genocide another 600,000 R remain in reine state in this very precarious situation and a quarter of those are confined to these squalled um IDP camps um they've been there since communal violence 12 years ago they can't move and we spoke to these seven people in five different camps just to confirm that this systematic constriction was going on the military government has denied it they say they're just getting ringers prepared to defend their own camps this is not what we heard we heard that the military been going around and telling the camp organizers that they must provide lists of young men ready to be conscripted uh between 15 and 25 from each Camp each time they came and these men were then selected they were told they had no choice that their families would be threatened by the military if they didn't comply they was sent for training taught out of fire guns and then thrown into battle and in rakine state where the ringas are there is a huge amount of conflict at the moment between an Insurgent Army the arican Army and the military the military has been pushed back it's been defeated there as it has been in many other parts of Myanmar and it's struggling to fill its ranks it's lost a lot of troops through desertion or through injuries and so it's simply using the ringas instead and they described horrific experiences of being thrown into these brutal battle chaotic battles uh where they suffered injuries they saw other reinges killed eventually they were sent back um to home after after the battle was over but they're sitting some of them have gone into hiding because they say that we're being told we might be summoned to go back and fight again and presumably Jonathan they they have no hope of that situation changing well they're trapped you see we we we know of lots of people in Myanmar after this conscription law was enforced in the last few weeks because the military can't get people to join the Army it's so unpopular lots of people in myama are fleeing they're either coming here to Thailand or they're going underground but these reinges are stuck in these camps they're never allowed to move anyway they're completely trapped and they're very easy for the military to go and just point a finger and say you've got to join but think of the Hideous irony here the military in particular uh does not recognize the reinges as having any legal right to live in Myanmar they've pursued these Dreadful policies against some of discrimination and outright um killings in back in 2017 they've always been regarded Ed almost as sort of UNP as people who just don't belong and yet now they're being forced to fight the military's battles and it has another bad knock on consequence because the local rakine Buddhist population the other community in rakine supports the insurgence and it's only going to inflame tensions between them and the reinges when the reinges are seen unwillingly of course fighting on the military side so it's going to store up a lot of problems to the Future it's Jonathan head in Bangkok\"],\n [{\n            'v': 28,\n

people have been rescued after floods in Northern Sydney other residents have been told to be prepared to flee their homes because of the rising flood waters the area's main reservoir which supplies most of the city's drinking water has started to overflow you can see that there there's been 3 days of torrential rainfall across eastern Australia people living in parts of New South Wales have been told to stay indoors it's important to note that flood levels in some of the rivers particularly in Western Sydney are continuing to rise and that presents a real danger for some communities so it's very important for those who live in communities that are lowly flood prone areas that you continue to listen to emergency broadcasts from the sces well let's speak to our Sydney correspondent Phil merer Phil uh what where do things stand right now well at the moment we know that there are two deaths that have been associated with these wild days of weather here in eastern Australia on Thursday a 71-year-old man was found in floodwaters near Brisbane in the state of Queensland and earlier today a man's body was found in flood waters in western parts of Sydney now the now the police here say that they don't know the circumstances of the second fatality but safe to say it has been a wild old few days in eastern Australia record-breaking amounts of rain have fallen here in the state of New South Wales across one 24-hour period A month's worth of rain fell so at the moment there have still there are still evacuation orders in place in parts of Sydney but um thankfully for the 5 million or so residents of this city this storm system is moving south and it is expected to head out to see over the weekend but as you'd imagine the flood warnings are continuing because all of that rain is flowing into rivers and creeks their levels are rising so with them uh the risk of flooding to low-lying areas and briefly was there any way to prepare to avoid some of the issues you just talked about some of the the dangers that people are facing Australia is a land well used to Nature's extremes the authorities are very good at giving Advanced warnings to motorists to homeowners and commuters but still people find themselves facing Peril as you mentioned dozens of people have had to be rescued by emergency services so it is uh a mercy in a way that although two people have died tragic of course for those family members left behind but it is an indication that Australia is pretty good at giving warnings to its citizens when when these extreme events um Rumble through communities in this country all right thank you so much for that update\"],\n [{\n            'v': 29,\n            'f': \"29\",\n        },\n\"2024-04-05 00:00:00\",\n\"BBC News\",\n\"Emergency

week's earthquake many are trapped in Highway tunnels or cut off in remote areas after the earthquake on Wednesday at least 10 people were killed in the Island's biggest quake in more than a quarter of a century but authorities say more bodies are expected to be recovered our correspondent rapet Winfield Hayes sent us this report from the capital taipe well it seems the situation has improved quite a lot today with those people who are trapped up in a Gorge about 15 km or about 10 mil to the west of here uh that that is a very deep gorge there are many landslides that have blocked the roads in there but rescue teams have managed to get in to where the people are stranded there's about 640 people trapped up there in a village where there is a hotel and there are other buildings so they are being sheltered there we understand around 400 of them are Sheltering in the hotel and the others in other uh buildings there so that they are safe they're not in immediate danger they are now getting supplies in there by helicopter but it is very difficult to get them out because the road is blocked by landslides you can only get in and out by foot they are bringing them out in small groups we saw about 40 people brought out today including people with young children and elderly people a group of elderly tourists from America were brought out but it is going to take just quite a long time to get so many people down that road in small groups especially as we've had a lot of aftershocks here today and every time there's an Aftershock that operation has to stop because it's bringing more rock uh uh coming tumbling down the mountain sides and very briefly rert looking at those efforts behind you um what's the situation like with with trying to stabilize buildings which have been affected by the Quake yeah well this is one of the buildings that was partially brought down by the Quake on Wednesday morning it's leaning over at a very precarious angle they have been putting rein reinforcing it but the plan now tonight is to start tearing that building down and the reason they want to bring it down is because it represents a real threat every time there's an Aftershock so they want to bring it down in a controlled way three pit Windfield Hayes in taipe speaking earlier to my colleague Anita mcy\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\",

            "hello I'm Nikki schill welcome to the program we start this hour with the latest developments in the Middle East President Biden has promised Israel Ironclad United States support amid fears that Iran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians Us Media are reporting that an American General visit Israel on Thursday to discuss Washington's fears President Biden warned at Iran is threatening to launch a significant attack after Israel struck the Iranian Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden was speaking hours after the Iranian supreme leader again said Israel would be punished for the strike on its consulate meanwhile the Hamas political leader ishmail hania says there'll be no change in the group's demands for a permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the killing of three of his sons in an Israeli air strike Israeli media is reporting that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed in advance of the attack this video is believed to show Ismael hania receiving the news in Qatar where he lives in Exile Israel has confirmed the strike describing the Suns as Hamas military operatives he's been actively involved in negotiations to broker a ceasefire with Israel demanding a permanent end to the fighting and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes we'll assess the implications of the killing of his sons in a moment first his President Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the region we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's go live to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea who is in Jerusalem we heard President Biden there Hugo there are real fears now over what Iran might do and the possibility of the conflict spreading wider in the region yeah and it's very interesting that over the last few days American officials have been saying that they believe this possible Iranian uh response to that attack in Damascus is a matter of when and not if and uh obviously you know we don't know what the Iranians are planning to do they have this network of factions across the region the socalled axes of resistance which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and Syria and all those players have already been involved in this conflict Hezbollah for example has been attacking Israel from Lebanon almost every day but I think the fear here is that Iran may be planning to launch an attack by itself uh you know from its own territory and that could be involving um missiles and drones and uh Israeli officials have been saying that uh they are going to retaliate to any kind of attack coming from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said they would give a significant response and uh I think you know in another sign of these concerns uh today the axio website is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is going to come to Israel to have conversations with the Israeli defense minister and also with u military officials and I think what President Biden was trying to say is that despite uh the differences uh you know between the Americans and the Israelis over the you know the Israeli conduct in the war in Gaza and we've seen in the last few days you know the level of frustration from America uh with Israel with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President Biden is saying that these two countries remain very strong allies and that any kind of Iranian attack on Israel would trigger uh an American reaction if we move now to that attack that killed the three sons of hamas's political lead what more do we know about the attack itself yeah so is ha is saying that this was a political assassination and that uh you know his reaction was that you know Israel would be delusional to think that this would change uh you know the position of Hamas in these ceasefire negotiations I think you know the key context here to this attack is that uh this happened as you know uh we're waiting to to hear from Hamas whether they're going to accept you know the ceasefire proposal that was put forward after those mediat negotiations in Cairo and uh at the heart of this proposal is a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in Gaza uh and uh you know this would see Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages were being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians were now being held in Israeli jails but many obstacles remain because it seems that Hamas has told negotiators that it doesn't have you know 40 hostages who fit the criteria that has been you know set up in this proposal you know female soldiers elderly people people who are sick uh and it seems that there's some differences as well uh related to the identity of the prisoners who are going to be released so we're still waiting to hear from Hamas but I think you know Hamas has been sticking with its you know demand that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza should be permanent because you know senior Hamas official said that they believe that any kind of temporary ceas fire would mean that once the hostages are out the Israelis May return to Gaza to finish the job and tried to destroy Hamas so they want a permanent ceasefire they want the end o of the war but we're still waiting to see uh you know how they're going to respond to this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle East correspondent live in Jerusalem thank you\n"
